**1\.  Introduction to AI:-**

* **1.1   Meaning of Intelligence** 

   
**Intelligence** – The ability of a system to calculate, reason, perceive relationships, learn from experience, store and retrieve information from memory, solve problems, classify, generalize, adapt to new situations, etc.

Intelligence is composed of,

1.Reasoning                                                                         

2.Learning                                                   

3.Problem Solving

4.Perception

5.Linguistic Intelligence

* **1.2   Meaning of Artificial Intelligence** 

**Artificial Intelligence:**

•AI was coined by John McCarthy in 1956\. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines that can display human intelligence and problem solving capabilities.

•Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines *"man-made,"* and intelligence defines *"thinking power"*, hence AI means *"a man-made thinking power.“*

   So, we can define AI as:

•"It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions."

* ### **1.3   Features  of AI :**

### **Ability to learn** − AI systems can improve their performance eventually by learning from data and past experiences.

### **Logical decision making** − AI systems are fed with large amounts of data to understand and recognize patterns for analysis and decision making.

### **Adaptability** − AI systems can adjust and adapt to changes in data.

### **Efficient automation** − AI would efficiently execute repetitive tasks and processes.

### **Versatility** − AI can be widely applied for various tasks across all fields like businesses, automotive, health, and many others.

* ## **1.4   Applications of AI:**

**Health care** − AI in healthcare is used to assist in tasks like diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatments and drug discovery.  
**Finance** − AI is used for fraud detection, trading and stock market analysis and customer service through chatbots.  
**Manufacturing and Industries** − AI optimizes production processes, improves quality and identifies machinery failure.  
**Agriculture** − AI helps combine technology with agriculture by analyzing soil conditions.
