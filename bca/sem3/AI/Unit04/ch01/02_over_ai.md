# **Overview of AI Domains:**

AI is a broad field made up of several domains, each focusing on specific types of intelligence or capabilities. Below are the **main domains of AI**, explained in a simple and organized way.

## **1.Machine Learning (ML):**

ML allows machines to **learn from data** and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

**Subdomains:**

* **Supervised Learning** — learns from labeled data  
* **Unsupervised Learning** — finds patterns in unlabeled data  
* **Reinforcement Learning** — learns by trial and error using rewards  
  **Examples:**  
* Spam filters  
* Stock price prediction  
* Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)

## **2.Deep Learning (DL):**

A subset of ML based on **artificial neural networks** (similar to the human brain).

## **Used in:**

* Image recognition  
* Speech recognition  
* Self-driving cars

## **3.Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

Enables machines to **understand, interpret, and generate human language**.

### **Examples:**

* ChatGPT  
* Translation (Google Translate)  
* Sentiment analysis (positive/negative reviews)

## **4.Computer Vision:**

AI that allows machines to **see and understand images and videos**.

### **Applications:**

* Facial recognition  
* Medical image analysis  
* Object detection in autonomous vehicles

## **5.Expert Systems:**

AI systems that mimic the decision-making ability of **human experts**.

### **Features:**

* Uses rules and logic  
* Solves complex domain-specific problems  
  **Examples:**  
* Medical diagnosis systems  
* Loan approval systems

## **6.Robotics:**

Combines AI with physical robots to perform actions in the real world.

### **Includes:**

* Motion planning  
* Perception  
* Manipulation

### **Examples:**

* Industrial robots (car manufacturing)  
* Humanoid robots  
* Drones

## **7.Fuzzy Logic:**

Handles **uncertain or imprecise information**, similar to human reasoning.

### **Use cases:**

* Washing machines  
* Climate control systems  
* Decision-making in uncertain environments

## **8.Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR\&R):**

Focuses on how AI **stores knowledge** and **applies logical reasoning**.

### **Examples:**

* Ontologies  
* Semantic networks  
* Logic-based reasoning

## **9.Planning and Scheduling:**

AI that can **set goals** and **create sequences of actions** to achieve them.

### **Examples:**

* Robotics path planning  
* Delivery route optimization  
* Project scheduling

**10.Reinforcement Learning (RL):**

Although part of ML, RL is often considered a major standalone domain.

### **Used in:**

* Game-playing AI (Chess, Go)  
* Robotics  
* Autonomous systems
