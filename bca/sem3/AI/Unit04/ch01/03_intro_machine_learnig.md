# **Introduction to Machine Learning:**

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **learn from data** and make decisions or predictions **without being explicitly programmed**.

## **Why Machine Learning?**

Traditional programming requires humans to write rules manually.  
Machine Learning allows the system to **find patterns automatically**.

### **Example:** If you give many photos of cats and dogs to an ML model:

* It *learns* the features  
* Then it can **predict** whether a new photo is a cat or dog

## **How Machine Learning Works:**

**1.Collect Data**  
 The system needs examples (images, text,numbers, etc.)

**2.Train a Model**  
 Use algorithms to learn patterns from the data.

**3.Test the Model**  
 Check how well the model performs on new data.

**4.Predict & Improve**  
 The model makes predictions and gets better with more data.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

Machine Learning is mainly divided into **three types**:

### **1.Supervised Learning:**

* Learns from **labeled data** (data with correct answers)  
* Used for **classification** and **regression** tasks  
  **Examples:**  
  → Email spam detection  
  → Predicting house prices  
  → Identifying handwritten digits

### **2.Unsupervised Learning:**

* Learns from **unlabeled data**  
* Finds **patterns, clusters, and relationships**  
  **Examples:**  
  → Customer segmentation  
  → Grouping similar images  
  → Detecting hidden patterns in data

### **3.Reinforcement Learning:**

* Agent learns by **trial and error**  
* Receives **rewards or penalties** for actions  
* Used where sequential decision-making is required  
  **Examples:**  
  → Self-driving cars  
  → Game-playing AI (Chess, Go)  
  → Robotics


## **Applications of Machine Learning:**

Machine Learning is used everywhere today:

* Self-driving cars  
* Fraud detection  
* Medical diagnosis  
* Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)  
* Chatbots and voice assistants  
* Stock market analysis  
* Smart home devices

## **Advantages:**

* Automates complex tasks  
* Improves accuracy over time  
* Handles large amounts of data  
* Helps in making better decisions

## **Disadvantages:**

* Requires large, clean datasets  
* Can produce biased results if data is biased  
* Requires high computational power  
* Difficult to explain how complex models work
