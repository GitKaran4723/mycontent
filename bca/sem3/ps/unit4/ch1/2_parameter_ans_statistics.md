# **Topic: Population and Sample (Concept, Need & Examples)**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

Statistics deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.  
 In real life, we often want to study a *large group* — such as all customers, all manufactured items, all students in a university, etc.  
 However, studying every element is often **impossible** or **too expensive**.  
 Therefore, we study a **small part** of the group.

This gives rise to two fundamental ideas:

* **Population**

* **Sample**

These two ideas form the foundation of **sampling distribution and statistical inference**.

## **2\. Population – Meaning**

A **population** is the *entire collection* of individuals, objects, items, or observations that we want to study.

### **Formal Definition:**

A *population* is the complete set of all units about which information is required.

### **Examples:**

* All students studying in an engineering college

* All bulbs produced in a factory in one week

* All customers visiting a shopping mall

* All houses in a city

* All transactions made in a bank in one month

### **Key Points:**

* Population may be **large** (e.g., all citizens of India).

* Population may be **small** (e.g., 40 students in a classroom).

* Population can be **finite** or **infinite**.

## **2.1 Types of Population**

### **a) Finite Population**

Contains a fixed number of elements.  
 Example:

* Number of students registered for a course

* Number of cars in a parking lot

### **b) Infinite Population**

Cannot be counted explicitly.  
 Example:

* Number of possible outcomes when repeatedly tossing a coin

* Possible measurements of temperature

* Lifetime of a machine (in theory infinite possibilities)

### **c) Real Population**

Physically exists in the real world.

### **d) Hypothetical Population**

Defined theoretically.  
 Example:

* “All possible outcomes of rolling a die”

* “All possible samples drawn from a distribution”

## **3\. Census vs Sample Survey**

Before understanding "sample", students should understand the difference:

### **Census**

Collecting information from *every element* of the population.  
 Examples:

* Population census by Government of India

* Counting all items in inventory

**Advantages:** Accurate  
 **Disadvantages:** Expensive, time-consuming, not possible for infinite populations

### **Sample Survey**

Collecting information from *a part* of the population.  
 Used in industries, business, research, quality control.

---

## **4\. Sample – Meaning**

A **sample** is a *subset* of the population chosen for study.

### **Formal Definition:**

A *sample* consists of one or more observations selected from the population.

### **Examples:**

* Selecting 100 households from a city

* Selecting 50 students from a college

* Inspecting 20 bulbs out of 10,000 produced

* Choosing 200 customers for a satisfaction survey

### **Why choose a sample?**

Because:

* Studying entire population is costly

* Time is limited

* Population is very large or infinite

* Quick decisions are needed

* Sampling gives reliable results if done properly

## **5\. Sampling – Why We Use It**

Sampling helps in:

### **1\. Saving Time**

Studying all items may take days or months.  
 Sampling gives quicker results.

### **2\. Reducing Cost**

Complete study (census) is expensive; sampling is cheaper.

### **3\. Practical Feasibility**

Some populations cannot be studied fully.  
 Example: Testing life of bulbs – you cannot test all bulbs to destruction.

### **4\. Accuracy**

Surprisingly, a well-designed sample often gives **more accurate** results than a poorly-conducted census.

### **5\. Destructive Testing**

Some items must be destroyed during testing (e.g., crash tests, durability tests).  
 Hence only samples can be tested.

---

## **6\. Elements, Units, Frame**

Students must understand these basic terms:

### **Element / Unit**

The individual member of the population being studied.  
 Example:

* A student

* A bulb

* A bank transaction

* A house

### **Sampling Frame**

A list of all units in the population from which sample is drawn.  
 Examples:

* Voter list

* Employee list

* Admission register

* List of manufactured products

If the sampling frame is incomplete → sampling error increases.

---

## **7\. Example to Understand Population & Sample**

### **Example 1: Student Height Study**

* **Population:** All 540 students in the college

* **Sample:** 40 students selected randomly

* **Unit:** One student

* **Characteristic:** Height (in cm)

* **Why sample?** Measuring all 540 students takes time; 40 is enough for estimation.

### **Example 2: Quality Control in a Factory**

A factory produces **10,000 bulbs per day**.

* **Population:** 10,000 bulbs

* **Sample:** Select 200 bulbs

* **Why?** Testing all bulbs will destroy them; samples are sufficient to estimate defect rate.

### **Example 3: Election Survey**

A news agency wants to predict election results.

* **Population:** All voters of the state

* **Sample:** 3,000 randomly selected voters

* **Why?** Cannot ask every voter. A well-chosen sample gives accurate predictions.

## **8\. Characteristics of a Good Sample**

A sample should be:

### **1\. Representative**

Should correctly reflect the population’s features.

### **2\. Adequate Size**

Large enough to give stable and reliable results.

### **3\. Randomly Selected**

Every unit should have an equal chance of selection.

### **4\. Free From Bias**

No prejudice in choosing sample units.

---

## **9\. Relationship Between Population & Sample**

* Population is the **whole**; Sample is the **part**.

* From sample information, we estimate **population parameters**.

* Statistics (like sample mean) are used to estimate parameters (like population mean).

This leads to **sampling distribution**.

## **10\. Summary Points for Revision**

✔ Population \= entire group  
 ✔ Sample \= part of population  
 ✔ Census \= complete enumeration  
 ✔ Sample survey \= partial study  
 ✔ Sampling saves time, cost, effort  
 ✔ Units, frame, representativeness are important  
 ✔ Used in engineering, business, quality control, research, surveys
