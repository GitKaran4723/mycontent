## **Topic: Parameters and Statistics (Concept, Role & Examples)**

---

# **1\. Introduction**

In the previous hour, we learned:

* A **population** is the entire group we want to study.

* A **sample** is a smaller part taken from the population.

Now, the next step is to understand:

* How do we use sample data to learn about the population?

* Why are sample values not permanent or fixed?

* What terms are used to describe population and sample?

The answer lies in **parameters** and **statistics**.

# **2\. Parameter – Meaning**

A **parameter** is a **numerical value** that describes some characteristic of the **entire population**.

### **Formal Definition:**

A *parameter* is a fixed numerical measure that describes a population.

### **Important Points:**

* Parameter belongs to **population**

* It is **constant** (fixed), but usually **unknown**

* We try to **estimate** parameters from sample data

---

## **2.1 Examples of Parameters**

### **1\. Population Mean (μ)**

Average value of a characteristic in the population.

**Example:**  
 Average height of *all* students in a college \= **μ \= 165 cm**

### **2\. Population Variance (σ²)**

How much population values vary from the mean.

**Example:**  
 σ² \= 90 cm² (for all students)

### **3\. Population Standard Deviation (σ)**

Square root of variance.

### **4\. Population Proportion (p)**

Proportion of population with a particular characteristic.

**Examples:**

* p \= 0.30 (30% of voters prefer a political party)

* p \= 0.06 (6% defect rate among all manufactured items)

### **5\. Population Median, Mode**

The median income of all households is a parameter.

### **6\. Population Correlation (ρ)**

Strength of relationship between two variables in the entire population.

---

# **3\. Statistic – Meaning**

A **statistic** is a **numerical value** calculated from the **sample data**.

### **Formal Definition:**

A *statistic* is a measurable characteristic of a sample.

### **Important Points:**

* Calculated only from **sample**

* Changes from sample to sample

* Used to **estimate the population parameter**

This changing nature leads to **sampling distribution** (next hours).

## **3.1 Examples of Statistics**

### **1\. Sample Mean (x̄)**

Average value from sample observations.

**Example:**  
 Sample of 40 students → average height \= **x̄ \= 162 cm**

### **2\. Sample Proportion (p̂)**

Proportion of sample with a certain property.

**Example:**  
 Survey of 100 voters, 32 support a party → p̂ \= 0.32

### **3\. Sample Variance (s²)**

Variance of sample data.

### **4\. Sample Standard Deviation (s)**

### **5\. Sample Correlation (r)**

Correlation between sample variables.

# **4\. Difference Between Parameter and Statistic**

| Feature | Parameter | Statistic |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Definition | Numerical characteristic of population | Numerical characteristic of sample |
| Population/Sample | Based on entire population | Based on sample |
| Symbol | μ, σ, σ², p, ρ | x̄, s, s², p̂, r |
| Value | Fixed (constant) | Varies from sample to sample |
| Known? | Usually unknown | Known (because sample data is available) |
| Purpose | True value of population | Used to estimate parameter |

---

# **5\. Why Do We Need Statistics to Estimate Parameters?**

In real life, we rarely know population values.  
 Example:

* You cannot measure the height of **all** Indians.

* You cannot test the lifetime of **all** manufactured bulbs.

* You cannot contact **every** voter before an election.

So we select a sample and calculate **statistics** → x̄, p̂, s.

These statistics **approximate the true population values** (parameters).

---

# **6\. Relationship Between Parameters & Statistics**

This relationship lies at the core of sampling distribution:

* Parameter \= **unknown constant**

* Statistic \= **known value calculated from sample**

* Statistic varies with each sample

* Sampling distribution shows the pattern of that variation

* Using sampling distribution, we estimate parameters and test hypotheses

---

# **7\. Real-Life Examples** 

---

## **Example 1: Manufacturing Defect Rate**

A factory manufactures **50,000 chips every day**.

* True defect rate of all chips \= **parameter (p)**

* Quality inspector selects a sample of 200 chips:

  * Finds 14 defective → sample proportion p̂ \= 14/200 \= 0.07

* This p̂ is used to estimate **p**.

---

## **Example 2: Average Income of Employees**

Company has **3,000 employees**.

* True average salary of all employees \= **μ**

* But HR only collects data from **100 employees**.

  * Sample mean salary \= x̄ \= ₹38,500

* HR uses this x̄ to estimate μ.

---

## **Example 3: Election Survey**

Election Commission wants to know what percentage of voters support Candidate A.

* True support in entire state \= **p** (unknown)

* News agency surveys **2,000 voters**.

  * 1,120 support candidate → p̂ \= 0.56

* p̂ is used to estimate the true p.

---

## **Example 4: Student Height Study**

* Population: All 540 students

* Population mean height \= **μ**

* A sample of 40 students is taken:

  * x̄ \= 163.2 cm

  * s \= 7.4 cm  
     These statistics help estimate the population parameters.

---

## **Example 5: Machine Life Testing**

* Lifetime of all bulbs \= population distribution

* Testing lifetime destroys the bulb → cannot test all

* So sample of 30 bulbs is tested

  * x̄ \= 1200 hours (sample mean)  
     This x̄ estimates population mean μ.

---

# **8\. Estimators and Estimates (Intro Concept)**

### **Estimator**

A formula or method that uses sample data to estimate a population parameter.  
 Example: x̄ is the estimator of μ.

### **Estimate**

The actual numerical value calculated from the sample.  
 Example: If x̄ \= 162.4 cm, that value is the estimate of μ.

We will discuss this more during inference.

---

# **9\. Bias and Unbiasedness (Concept)**

A statistic should ideally estimate the parameter **without systematic error**.

* Sample mean x̄ is **unbiased estimator** of μ

* Sample proportion p̂ is **unbiased estimator** of p

These are needed for understanding estimation later.

 ✔ Statistic belongs to the **sample**  
 ✔ Parameters are **fixed but unknown**  
 ✔ Statistics are **known but vary**  
 ✔ Statistics help in estimating parameters  
 ✔ Used in surveys, industrial quality control, research, elections
