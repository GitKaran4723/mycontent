## **Topic: Sampling Distribution — Concepts Only**

---

# **1\. Introduction**

In the last two hours, students learned:

* A population contains all units

* A sample is a small part of the population

* Parameters describe populations (μ, σ, p)

* Statistics describe samples (x̄, s, p̂)

Now the key question arises:

### **If we repeatedly take samples from the same population, will we get the same statistic each time?**

**Answer: No.**  
 Every sample gives a different value → this creates a **distribution of statistics**.

This distribution is called the **Sampling Distribution**.

---

# **2\. What is Sampling Distribution?**

### **Formal Definition:**

A **sampling distribution** is the **probability distribution** of a **sample statistic** (like mean, proportion, variance) calculated from **all possible samples** of a fixed size drawn from the population.

### **Simpler Meaning:**

It is the pattern formed by the values of a statistic (for example, sample mean x̄) when you repeatedly take samples from the population.

---

# **3\. Why Do Sample Statistics Vary?**

Two samples drawn from the same population may give:

* Different means (x̄)

* Different proportions (p̂)

* Different standard deviations (s)

Why?

Because each sample contains **different individuals/items**, so the calculated statistic changes.

This variation is the basis of **sampling distribution**.

---

# **4\. Key Idea: Statistic as a Random Variable**

A statistic (x̄, p̂, s) is a **random variable** because its value changes depending on which sample you pick.

Thus:

* x̄ has a distribution

* p̂ has a distribution

* s has a distribution

These are called **sampling distributions**.

# **5\. Example to Understand the Concept (Teaching Example)**

### **Example: Heights of Students**

Population of 2000 students → true μ \= 160 cm, σ \= 10 cm  
 You draw **samples of size 5** again and again.

Sample 1: heights → mean \= 158  
 Sample 2: heights → mean \= 162  
 Sample 3: heights → mean \= 155  
 Sample 4: heights → mean \= 161

If you collect **all possible sample means**, you will get a **distribution of x̄**.

That distribution is the **sampling distribution of the sample mean**.

# **6\. Components of a Sampling Distribution**

### **1\. Sampling Distribution of Sample Mean (x̄)**

(covered in next hour)

### **2\. Sampling Distribution of Sample Proportion (p̂)**

(covered in hour 5\)

### **3\. Sampling Distribution of Sample Variance (s²)**

(higher-level concept, not included in syllabus)

For Hour 3, we only focus on **conceptual understanding of sampling distribution**.

---

# **7\. Why Sampling Distribution is Important? (Purpose)**

Sampling distribution is the **foundation of statistical inference**.

It helps answer questions like:

* How close is the sample mean to the population mean?

* How much error can we expect in a sample estimate?

* How confident can we be about our estimate?

* What is the probability that a sample statistic lies within a range?

Without sampling distribution:

* We cannot calculate confidence intervals

* We cannot perform hypothesis testing

* We cannot estimate parameters reliably

---

# **8\. Two Key Features of Sampling Distributions**

Sampling distributions help us understand two important properties of sample statistics:

---

## **1\. Expected Value (Center of Distribution)**

The expected value of the sampling distribution of x̄ equals the population mean.

### **E(x̄) \= μ**

This means:  
 On average, the sample mean equals the population mean.

---

## **2\. Standard Error (Spread of Distribution)**

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the:

# **Standard Error (SE)**

It measures **how much the statistic varies from sample to sample**.

### **For sample mean:**

SE \= σ / √n  
 (n \= sample size)

As sample size increases → SE decreases → estimates become stable.

---

# **9\. Visual Understanding (How to Explain in Class)**

Imagine the population as a big box of numbers.

When we:

* Draw one sample → get one mean

* Draw another sample → get another mean

* Draw many samples → many means

Plot these means → get a bell-shaped distribution.

This is the **sampling distribution**.

---

# **10\. SIMPLE REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES (Very Useful for Students)**

---

## **Example 1: Election Polling**

Suppose true support for a party \= 55%  
 Survey 1000 people → get p̂ \= 54%  
 If we repeat the survey:

* Sometimes p̂ \= 55%

* Sometimes \= 53%

* Sometimes \= 57%

These values form a **sampling distribution of p̂**.

---

## **Example 2: Quality Control in a Factory**

True defect rate of chips \= 3%  
 Every hour QA team tests 100 chips.

Each sample may show: 2% defects, 4% defects, 5% defects, 3% defects.

These values form a **sampling distribution of sample proportion**.

---

## **Example 3: Average Marks of Students**

Population: All 300 students in college  
 Sample: 30 students

Take different samples of size 30:

* Sample 1 mean \= 62

* Sample 2 mean \= 59

* Sample 3 mean \= 63

* Sample 4 mean \= 61

These means form a **sampling distribution of x̄**.

---

# **11\. Links Between Sampling Distribution and Inference**

### **(a) Sampling distribution tells us the behavior of x̄**

How much x̄ fluctuates around μ.

### **(b) Allows us to compute confidence intervals**

Example:  
 95% CI \= x̄ ± 1.96(SE)

### **(c) Allows hypothesis testing**

Example:  
 Test whether μ \= 50 using sample mean.

Thus sampling distribution is the “bridge” between **sample data** and **population conclusion**.

# **12\. Summary (Revision Points)**

✔ Sampling distribution \= distribution of a statistic from repeated samples  
 ✔ Statistic is a random variable  
 ✔ Distribution has a center (expected value) and spread (standard error)  
 ✔ Sampling distribution allows estimation and hypothesis testing  
 ✔ Larger samples → smaller standard error → more accuracy  
 ✔ Foundation for confidence intervals, Z-tests, T-tests
