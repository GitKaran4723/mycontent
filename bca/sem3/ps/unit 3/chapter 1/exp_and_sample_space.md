**Experiment and Sample Space**

---

## **1\. What is an Experiment?**

* In everyday life, the word *experiment* means "to try something and see what happens."

* In **probability**, an **experiment (or random experiment)** is an action or process that:

  1. Can be repeated under the same conditions.

  2. Has two or more possible outcomes.

  3. The outcome cannot be predicted with certainty **before** it happens.

👉 **Key idea:** An experiment in probability is not like a science lab experiment—it simply means doing something where chance is involved.

### **Examples of Experiments:**

1. Tossing a coin → Outcome could be **Head (H)** or **Tail (T)**.

2. Rolling a die → Outcome could be any number from **1 to 6**.

3. Drawing a card from a pack → Outcome could be **Ace, King, Queen, etc.**

4. Checking if a machine works → Outcome could be **Works / Fails**.

## **2\. Trial**

* A **trial** is one single performance of an experiment.

* Example:

  * Tossing a coin once → **one trial**.

  * Tossing it 5 times → **five trials**.

* Each trial may give different outcomes.

👉 **Think of a trial as pressing “Play” once on the experiment.**

---

## **3\. Outcome**

* An **outcome** is the result of a trial of an experiment.

* Example:

  * Toss a coin → Outcome \= **Head**.

  * Roll a die → Outcome \= **4**.

👉 An outcome is **one single result**.

---

## **4\. Sample Space (S)**

* The **sample space** is the set of **all possible outcomes** of an experiment.

* Denoted by ( S ).

* Example: Tossing a coin → ( S \= {H, T} ).

* Example: Rolling a die → ( S \= {1,2,3,4,5,6} ).

### **Important Point:**

* Each element in the sample space is called a **sample point**.

* Together, all sample points cover every possible outcome.

## **5\. Example – Tossing Two Coins**

* Experiment: Toss two coins simultaneously.

* Possible outcomes:

  1. First coin \= Head, Second coin \= Head → HH

  2. First coin \= Head, Second coin \= Tail → HT

  3. First coin \= Tail, Second coin \= Head → TH

  4. First coin \= Tail, Second coin \= Tail → TT

So,

 S \= {HH, HT, TH, TT}

👉 There are **4 possible outcomes** in the sample space.

---

## **6\. Example – Rolling Two Dice**

* Experiment: Roll two dice at the same time.

* Each die has 6 outcomes → total possible outcomes \= ( 6 \\times 6 \= 36 ).

* Sample Space:

   S \= {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ….. , (6,6)}

   Each outcome is a pair (Die 1 result, Die 2 result).

---

## **7\. Why is Sample Space Important? (Purpose)**

* **Foundation of Probability:** Probability of any event is calculated as:  
     
   P(E) \= No. of favorable outcomesTotal outcomes in S

* If we do not clearly define the sample space, probability calculations can go wrong.

### **Real-life Connections:**

1. In quality control → Sample space \= {Defective, Non-defective}.

2. In weather forecasting → Sample space \= {Rain, No Rain}.

3. In elections → Sample space \= {Candidate A wins, Candidate B wins}.

👉 **By identifying the sample space, we create a complete picture of all possibilities before assigning probabilities.**

✅ **Quick Recap:**

* **Experiment:** A process with uncertain results (e.g., toss coin, roll die).

* **Trial:** One attempt of the experiment.

* **Outcome:** The result of a single trial.

* **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes.

* **Purpose:** Provides the groundwork for calculating probabilities.
