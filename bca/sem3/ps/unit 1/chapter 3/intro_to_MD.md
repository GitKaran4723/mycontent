## **Measures of Dispersion**

## **🎯 Why Measures of Dispersion are Needed**

### **✅ 1\. Central Tendency shows the center, not the spread**

* Suppose two classes have the same **average score** (say, 70 marks)

* But in Class A, all students scored **between 68–72**

* In Class B, scores ranged **from 40 to 100**

**Conclusion**: Mean is the same, but **variability is very different**

➡️ Central tendency is **not enough** — we need **dispersion** to know how *spread out* or *consistent* the data is.

---

### **✅ 2\. Dispersion tells us about data reliability**

* **Low dispersion** → values are close to center → more **stable & reliable**

* **High dispersion** → values are spread out → less reliable for prediction

🔍 *Example*:  
 Two machines produce screws:

* Machine A: Screw lengths vary by ±0.1 mm

* Machine B: Screw lengths vary by ±1.5 mm

Even if **average length is same**, Machine A is clearly more **accurate**

---

### **✅ 3\. Essential for comparing datasets**

* Just comparing means is **misleading**

* Dispersion lets us compare **consistency**, **risk**, **variation**

🔍 *Example*:  
 Two investment plans give:

* Same average return \= 10%

* But Plan X has fluctuation between 9–11%

* Plan Y between 0–20%

➡️ Plan X is **safer** → lower dispersion

---

### **✅ 4\. Foundation for further statistics**

* Concepts like **probability distributions**, **hypothesis testing**, **regression**, and **confidence intervals** all **depend on standard deviation or variance**

Without dispersion:

* We **cannot measure risk**

* We **cannot understand normal distribution**

* We **cannot build statistical models**

## **📌 Summary Table**

| Feature | Central Tendency | Measures of Dispersion |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Tells about | Center (mean/median/mode) | Spread or variability |
| Uses | Average, common value | Consistency, reliability, risk |
| Ignores | How far data lies from center | — |
| Needed when | You compare two or more datasets | Always needed to interpret data fully |
