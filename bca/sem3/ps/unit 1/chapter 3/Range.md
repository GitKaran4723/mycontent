**1\. RANGE**  
---

### **✅ Definition**

**Range** is the **difference between the maximum and minimum values** in a data set.  
 It tells **how wide** the values are spread.

Range=Maximum Value−Minimum Value

---

### **🎯 Purpose / Why We Use It**

* **Quick snapshot** of variability in data

* Useful in **weather**, **sports**, **quality control**, **finance**, etc.

* Helpful to **compare consistency** (lower range \= more consistent)

### **🔍 Examples**

#### **Example 1: Exam Scores**

A student's marks in 5 subjects:  
 **80, 92, 65, 74, 88**

Range=92−65=27

The spread of scores is **27 marks**.

#### **Example 2: Daily Temperatures (°C)**

Data: 24, 28, 30, 25, 26, 27, 29

Range=30−24=6 C

Temperature fluctuated by **6°C** over the week.

#### **Example 3: Cricket Runs**

Runs by a batsman in 5 matches:  
 **20, 45, 38, 10, 100**

Range=100−10=90

➡️ A very **high range** shows inconsistency in performance.

### **📌 Properties of Range**

| Feature | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| 📉 Simplicity | Very easy to calculate |
| ⚠️ Sensitive | Affected by extreme values (outliers) |
| ❌ Doesn't use all data | Only considers two values |
| 🤏 Best for small data | Not good for large, skewed data sets |

### **🧠 Real-Life Applications**

| Field | Use of Range |
| ----- | ----- |
| 🌦️ Meteorology | Temperature variability in a city |
| 🎓 Education | Spread of student scores in a class |
| 🏭 Manufacturing | Checking consistency in product size |
| 📈 Finance | Price fluctuation in stock market |
