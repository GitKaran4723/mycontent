**Data Models-**Introduction and Importance 

What is a Data Model?

 A Data Model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is structured, stored, and accessed in a database system.

 It defines: 

*  What data will be stored.  
*  How the data is organized.  
*  Relationships between data items.  
*  Constraints on the data.  
*  And how the data will be retrieved or manipulated. 

**Note:** A data model is a blueprint or plan that guides the creation of a database.

 **Purpose of Data Models** 

The purpose of using data models is to:  

* Simplify the design of databases.   
*  Ensure consistency, accuracy, and clarity in data handling.   
*  Act as a communication bridge between database designers, developers, and end-users.
