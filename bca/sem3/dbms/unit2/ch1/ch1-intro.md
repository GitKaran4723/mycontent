## **ðŸ”¶ Relational Algebra and Calculus**

### **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Relational Algebra**

A procedural query language that uses operations on relations to produce new relations.

### **ðŸ”¹ Operations in Relational Algebra**

* **Selection (Ïƒ)**: Filters rows based on a condition  
* **Projection (Ï€)**: Selects specific columns  
* **Set Operations**: Union, Intersection, Difference  
* **Join Operations**: Combines tuples from two relations  
* **Division**: Finds tuples related to all tuples in another relation  
* **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**: Non-procedural, uses tuple variables  
* **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**: Uses domain variables and logical formulas
