**UNIT 2: Introduction to Relational Algebra in DBMS**

Relational Algebra is a formal language used for querying and manipulating relational databases. It consists of a set of operations like selection, projection, union, and join. This mathematical framework ensures efficient data retrieval and manipulation, serving as the foundation for SQL. 

Relational algebra simplifies database querying, making it easier to understand and optimize query execution for better performance. It is essential for learning SQL because SQL queries are based on relational algebra operations, enabling users to effectively retrieve data.Key Concepts in Relational Algebra

Before discussing relational algebra operations, let's define some fundamental concepts:

1. **Relations**: In relational algebra, a relation is a table with rows and columns, representing structured data. Each relation has a unique name and is composed of tuples.  
2. **Tuples**: A tuple is a single row in a relation, containing a set of values for each attribute. It represents a single data entry or record in a relational table.  
3. **Attributes**: Attributes are the columns in a relation, each representing a specific characteristic or property of the data. For example, in a "Students" relation, attributes could include "Name," "Age," and "Grade."  
4. **Domains**: A domain is the set of possible values an attribute can have. It defines the type of data that can be stored in each column of a relation, such as integers, strings, or dates.
