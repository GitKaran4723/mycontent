## **1\. Introduction: Role of Algorithms in Computing**

**Meaning:**  
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step method to solve a problem and get the correct output from given input.

**Role in Computing:**

* Tells the computer **what to do and in what order**  
* Helps in **solving problems logically**  
* Makes programs **efficient, correct, and reliable**  
* Used in all areas: searching, sorting, AI, databases, networking, etc.

**Example:**  
Searching a name in a list → use a searching algorithm.

## **2\. Algorithms as a Technology**

**Meaning:**  
Algorithms are not just theory, they are **tools that improve performance of software and systems**.

**Why Important:**

* Faster algorithms \= faster applications  
* Saves memory and computing power  
* Helps in handling **big data and large systems**

**Examples:**

* Google search uses fast searching algorithms  
* Banking systems use secure encryption algorithms

---

## **3\. Analyzing Algorithms**

**Meaning:**  
Studying how much **time and memory** an algorithm uses.

**Two Main Measures:**

1. **Time Complexity** → How fast the algorithm runs  
2. **Space Complexity** → How much memory it uses

**Why Needed:**

* To choose the **best algorithm** for large inputs  
* To avoid slow and memory-heavy programs

**Common Notation:**

* Big O notation (O(n), O(n²), O(log n))

---

## **4\. Designing Algorithms**

**Meaning:**  
The process of **creating a logical solution** before writing the program.

**Steps:**

1. Understand the problem  
2. Identify input and output  
3. Write steps in order  
4. Test the logic  
5. Convert into code

**Design Methods:**

* Divide and Conquer  
* Step-by-step refinement  
* Use of flowcharts and pseudocode

---

## **5\. Flow Charts**

**Meaning:**  
A **diagram representation** of an algorithm using symbols and arrows.

**Purpose:**

* Makes logic easy to understand  
* Helps in debugging  
* Useful for teaching and planning programs

**Common Symbols:**

* Oval → Start/End  
* Rectangle → Process  
* Diamond → Decision  
* Arrow → Flow direction

## **6\. Exchanging the Values of Two Variables**

**Meaning:**  
Swapping values of two variables.

**Example:**  
If A \= 5 and B \= 10 → After swap → A \= 10, B \= 5

**Methods:**

* Using a temporary variable  
* Without using a temporary variable (using arithmetic or XOR)

---

## **7\. Counting**

**Meaning:**  
Finding the **number of elements** in a set or list.

**Example:**  
Count how many numbers are in an array.

**Use:**

* Used in statistics  
* Used in loops and data processing

---

## **8\. Summation of a Set of Numbers**

**Meaning:**  
Finding the **total sum** of given numbers.

**Example:**  
1 \+ 2 \+ 3 \+ 4 \= 10

**Method:**

* Use a loop to add each number to a sum variable

---

## **9\. Factorial Computation**

**Meaning:**  
Factorial of a number is the **product of all positive integers up to that number**.

**Notation:**  
n\!

**Example:**  
5\! \= 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 \= 120

**Use:**

* Permutations and combinations  
* Mathematical and probability problems

---

## **10\. Generating Fibonacci Sequence**

**Meaning:**  
A series where each number is the **sum of the previous two numbers**.

**Example:**  
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

**Rule:**  
F(n) \= F(n-1) \+ F(n-2)

---

## **11\. Reversing the Digits of an Integer**

**Meaning:**  
Changing the order of digits in a number.

**Example:**  
Input: 1234  
Output: 4321

**Method:**

* Extract last digit using modulus (%)  
* Build reversed number using multiplication and addition

---

## **12\. Character to Number Conversion**

**Meaning:**  
Converting a character digit into a numeric value.

**Example:**  
Character `'5'` → Number `5`

**Method:**

* Subtract ASCII value of `'0'`  
* Used in reading numbers from keyboard input
