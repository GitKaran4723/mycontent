# **Set Operations**

*Set Operations can be defined as the operations performed on two or more sets to obtain a single set containing a combination of elements from all the sets being operated upon.* 

1. ##  ***Union of Sets***

The **union of set** A and B, denoted by **A ∪ B,** is the set of distinct elements that belong to set A or set B, or both. This operation can be represented as;

*A ∪ B \= {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B}*
