# **Set Difference** 

The difference between sets is denoted by **'A \- B'**, which is the set containing elements that are in A but not in B i.e., all elements of A except the element of B.

## **Venn Diagram For Set Difference**

In the below diagram, the **set difference** A−B contains all the elements that are in A but not in B.

**Example:** If A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}, find A \- B.  
**Solution:** A \- B \= {1, 3, 5}

***We can also state that the difference between set A and set B is equivalent to the intersection of set A with the complement of set B. Therefore,***

***A − B = A ∩ B′***

***where B′ = the complement of set B.***

# ***Symmetric Difference***

The symmetric difference between two sets **A** and **B** is denoted as **A Δ B** and is defined as the set of elements that are in either set but not in their intersection. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

***A Δ B = (A \- B) ∪ (B \-A)***

Where,

* A \- B is a set of elements in A, but not in B,  
* B \- A is a set of elements in B, but not in A.

The **symmetric difference** can also be understood as union of both sets minus their intersection:

***A Δ B = (A ⋃ B) \- (A ⋂ B)***

## ***Venn Diagram For Symmetric Difference***

The symmetric difference AΔB includes elements that are in either A or B but not in both.

**Example**: Let set A = {1, 2, 3}, and set B = {3, 4, 5}, then Find the symmetric difference

**Solution:** A △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}
