# **Complement of a Set**

If U is a universal set and X is any subset of U, then the complement of X consists of all the elements in U that are not in X.

**X' = {a : a∈ U and a ∉ X}**

 **The complement of A, denoted as A′.**

## **Venn Diagram For Complement of a Set**

In the diagram below, set A' includes all elements not in A, relative to the universal set.

**Example:** Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} And A = {1, 2, 5, 6}

**Solution:**   A′ = {3, 4, 7, 8}

# **Relative Complement of a Set**

The **relative complement** of a set **A** with respect to a set **B** is the set of all elements that belong to **B** but do **not** belong to **A**.

**denoted as: B∖A**

**B∖A={x ∣ x ∈ B and x ∉ A}**

## **Venn Diagram For Relative Complement of a Set**

In the diagram below,  **relative complement** of **A in B**  consists of elements that are **in B but not in A**.

**Example:** let A = { 1, 2, 3 } B = { 3, 4, 5, 6 }

**Solution:**  B∖A = { 4, 5, 6 }
