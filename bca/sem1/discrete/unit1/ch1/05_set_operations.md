# **Set Operations**

Set Operations can be defined as the operations performed on two or more sets to obtain a single set containing a combination of elements from all the sets being operated upon.

##  ***1. Union of Sets***

The **union of set** A and B, denoted by **A ∪ B,** is the set of distinct elements that belong to set A or set B, or both. This operation can be represented as;

**A ∪ B = {x: x ∈ A or x ∈ B}**

**Example:** Find the union of A = {2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}.  
**Solution:** A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5}.

##  ***2. Intersection of Sets***

The **intersection of set** A and B, denoted by **A ∩ B**, is the set of elements that belong to both A and B, i.e. set of the common elements in A and B. This operation is represented as:

**A∩B = {x: x ∈ A and x ∈ B}**

### ***Venn Diagram For Intersection of Sets***

The area shaded in yellow represents A∩B or the intersection of sets A and B, which includes the elements common to both sets A and B.

**Example:** Find the intersection of A = {2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5}
**Solution:**  A ∩ B = {3, 4}.

***The intersection of sets A and B can also be interpreted as:***

***n (A ∩B) = n (A) \+ n (B) \- n (A∪B)***

Where,

* n(A) = the cardinality (or number of elements) of set A,  
* n(B) = the cardinality of set B,
* n(A∪B) = the cardinality of the union of sets A and B.

##  ***3. Disjoint Set***

Two sets are said to be **disjoint** if their intersection is the **empty set**  i.e., sets have no common elements. In simpler terms, they don’t “overlap” at all.  
So if you try to find their intersection, you’ll get the empty set, which we denote by the symbol ϕ or {}.

### ***Venn Diagram For Disjoint Sets***

The sets A and B are disjoint, meaning they have no common elements (no overlap).

 **For Example:** Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}

**Solution:** A and B are disjoint sets since both of them have no common elements.
