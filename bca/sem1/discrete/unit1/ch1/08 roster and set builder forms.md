#  **Roster Form**
 The roster form defines a set by explicitly listing all of its elements inside curly braces { }.

**General format: A = { a1, a2, a3, …  }**

**Examples**

* A={1,2,3,4}  
* V={a,e,i,o,u}

### **Notes**

* Order does not matter  
* No duplicates allowed  
* Best used when the set is small or finite

# **Set-Builder Form** 
The set-builder form defines a set by stating a rule or property that all elements must satisfy.

**General format: A={x∣condition on x}**
(read as “the set of all x such that …”)

**Examples**

* A = { x∣x is an even integer and 1 ≤ x ≤ 8 }

* V = { x∣x is a vowel in the English alphabet}

* S = { x ∈ N ∣x \< 5 }


## **Converting Between Forms**

**Roster → Set-Builder**
{ 2, 4, 6, 8 } ⇒ { x∣x = 2n,  n ∈ N,  1 ≤ n ≤ 4}  

**Set-Builder → Roster**  
{ x ∈ Z∣ −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 } ⇒ { −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 }
