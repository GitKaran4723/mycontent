# **Commutative Law**  
 The Commutative Law means the order of sets doesn't matter for union (∪) or intersection (∩)

## **Union:**
 **A ∪ B = B ∪ A** (The elements in the union of A and B are the same as in B and A).

## **Intersection:** 
**A ∩ B = B ∩ A** (The elements common to A and B are the same as those common to B and A). 


# **Associative Law**   
 The Associative Law means grouping of sets doesn't change the result for three or more sets

## **Union:**
**( A ∪ B ) ∪ C = A ∪ ( B ∪ C )**

## **Intersection:**   
**( A ∩ B ) ∩ C = A ∩ ( B ∩ C )**
