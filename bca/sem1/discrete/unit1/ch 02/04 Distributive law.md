# **Distributive Laws**

## **Intersection distributes over Union:**

Meaning: Finding the elements common to set A AND (B or C) is the same as finding elements common to (A and B) OR (A and C).

**A ∪ ( B ∩ C ) = ( A ∪ B ) ∩ ( A ∪ C )**

## **Union distributes over Intersection**:

Meaning: Finding elements in A OR (B and C) is the same as finding elements in (A or B) AND (A or C). 

**A ∩ ( B ∪ C ) = ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ C )**
