# **Idempotent Law**

The idempotent laws in set theory simplify operations involving sets by stating that performing the operation on a set yields the set itself. These laws apply to both the union and intersection operations and are fundamental to the understanding of set relationships. Let’s delve into each law with the proofs and explanations.

## **1. Intersection Idempotence**

The intersection idempotence law states that:

 ***The intersection of a set with itself results in the set itself. This is because all elements in A are common to both the A and A. Thus, the intersection of the A with itself does not change the set.***

***A ∩ A = A***

## **2. Union Idempotence**

The union idempotence law states that:

***The union of a set with itself results in the set itself. This is because all elements in the A are included in A ∪ A as the union operation combines all elements from both the sets which are identical in this case.***

***A ∪ A = A***

# ** Complement Laws**

## **1. Union complement**

   If A is a subset of the universal set then A' is also a subset of the universal set, therefore the union of A and A' is the universal set, represented as  ***A ∪ A’ = U***

## **2. Intersection complement**

   The intersection of Set A and A' provides the empty set“∅”, represented as ***A ∩ A’ = ∅***

For example, If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {4 , 5}, then A' = {1, 2, 3 }. Now, notice that A ∪ A’ = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Also, A ∩ A’ = ∅

# **Law of Double Complementation**

* In this law, the complement of the complemented set is the original set, ***(A')' \= A***  
* The complement of the set A′, where A′ itself is the complement of A, the double complement of A is thus A itself.

For example, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {4 , 5} then A' = {1 , 2 , 3 }.  
The complement of A' = (A')' = {4, 5}, which is equal to set A.
