# **Identity Laws**

Identity laws state that there exist certain sets which, when combined with another set using union or intersection, do not change the original set.

These special sets act as identity (neutral) elements.


## **(a) Identity Law for Union**

**Statement: A∪∅=A**

**Explanation**

* The empty set contains no elements  
* Union means combining all elements
* Since ∅ has nothing to add, the result remains A

**Example**

Let: A = { 1,  2,  3 }  
Then: A ∪ ∅ = { 1, 2, 3 } ∪ { } = { 1, 2, 3 }  

**Conclusion**
The empty set is the identity element for union.


## **(b) Identity Law for Intersection**

**Statement: A∩U=A**

**Explanation**

* The universal set contains every possible element  
* Intersection means common elements  
* Every element of A is already in U, so nothing is lost

**Example**

Let: U = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } , A = { 2, 4 }  
Then: A ∩ U = { 2, 4 }  

**Conclusion**

The universal set is the identity element for intersection.


# **Domination Laws**

**Definition**

Domination laws describe situations where one set completely controls the result, regardless of the other set.

Such sets are called dominating elements.


## **(a) Domination Law for Union**

**Statement : A∪U=U**

**Explanation**

* Union means all elements from both sets  
* Since U already has all possible elements, adding A changes nothing  
* The result must be U

**Example**

Let  : U = { 1, 2, 3, 4 } , A = { 2 }  
Then: A∪U = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

### **Conclusion**

The universal set dominates union.


## **(b) Domination Law for Intersection**

**Statement: A∩∅=∅**

**Explanation**

* Intersection means common elements 
* The empty set has no elements  
* Therefore, no common elements are possible

**Example**

Let:A = { 1, 2, 3 }  
Then: A∩∅ = { }

**Conclusion**

The empty set dominates the intersection.
