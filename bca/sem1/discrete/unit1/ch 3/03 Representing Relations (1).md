#  **Representing Relations**

**Relations** are represented using ordered pairs, matrix and digraphs:

## **1. Ordered Pairs** 

In this set of ordered pairs of x and y are used to represent relation. In this corresponding values of x and y are represented using parenthesis.

**Example:**

 {(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)}

This represent square of a number which means if x=1 then y = x\*x = 1 and so on.

## **2. Representing using Matrix** 

 In this zero-one is used to represent the relationship that exists between two sets. In this if an element is present then it is represented by 1 else it is represented by 0\. In this method it is easy to judge if a relation is reflexive, symmetric or transitive just by looking at the matrix.

**Example:**

A ={1, 2, 3} and B={1, 2} and Relation R is R = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)} then all corresponding value of Relation will be represented by "1" else "0". It is represented as:

Its corresponding possible relations are:

## **3. Digraph**   
 A digraph is known as directed graph. It consists of a set 'V' of vertices and with the edges 'E'. Here E is represented by an ordered pair of Vertices. In the edge (a, b), a is the initial vertex and b is the final vertex. If edge is (a, a) then this is regarded as a loop. 

**Example:**

R = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)}

This relation is represented using digraph as:
