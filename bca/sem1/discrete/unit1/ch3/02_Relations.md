# **Relations** 

A relation is defined as the relationship between two sets. If we are given two sets, set A and set B, and set A has a relation with set B, then each value of set A is related to a value of set B through some unique relation. Here, set A is called the domain of the relation, and set B is called the range of the relation.

### **Example of a Relation**

1\. There are two sets X = {4, 36, 49, 50} and Y = {1, \-2, \-6, \-7, 7, 6, 2}. A relation R states that  
"(x, y) is in the relation R if x is a square of y" can be represented using ordered pairs,

R = {(4, \-2), (4, 2), (36, \-6), (36, 6), (49, \-7), (49, 7)}

2\. The image added below shows two sets, A and B, and the relation between them.

Set A = {x, y, z }  Set B = {1, 2, 3}

## **Representation of Relations**

In **Set theory** we can represent the relation using different techniques, and the two important ways to represent the set are,

* **Set builder Notation**  
* **Roaster Notation**

## **Set Builder Notation**

If a relation between two sets is represented using the logical formula, then this type of representation is called the **set builder notation**.

**For example,** if we are given two sets, set **X = {2, 4, 6}** and set **Y = {4, 8, 12}.** Then, on observing clearly, we can see that each element of set Y is twice each element of set X the relation between them is,

***R {(a, b): b is twice of a, a ∈ X, b ∈ Y}***

## **Roaster Form**

**Roaster form** is another way of representing a relation. In roaster form, we use ordered pairs to represent the relation.

**For example,** if we are given two sets, set **X = {2, 4, 6}** and set **Y = {4, 8, 12}**. Then the relation between set X and set Y is represented using the relation R such that,

***R = {(2, 4), (4, 8), (6, 12)}***
