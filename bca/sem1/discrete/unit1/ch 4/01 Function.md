# **Function**

A function is a special relation or method connecting each member of set A to a unique member of set B via a defined relation. Set A is called the domain, and set B is called the co-domain of the function. A function in mathematics from set A to set B is defined as,

***f = {(a,b)| ∀ a ∈ A, b ∈ B}***

A function in mathematics is a relation between the input values (domain) and the output values (range) of the given sets, such that no two variables from the domain sets are linked to the same variable in the range set.

## **Condition for a Function**

For any two non-empty sets A and B, a function **f: A→B** denotes that **f** is a function from A to B, where **A** is a domain and **B** is a co-domain.

For any element, a ∈ A, a unique element, b ∈ B, is there such that (a,b) ∈ f. The unique element b, which is related to a, is denoted by f(a) and is read as f of a. This can be better understood from the image below:

## **How to Identify a Function?**

The function is classified as a special type of relation in math. There are the following rules that can be used to identify a function:

* A relation in which each input is mapped to a unique output is a Function. This is called one to one function.  
* A relation in which two inputs (preimage) are mapped to a single output is also a Function. This is a many-to-one function.  
* A relation in which one input is mapped to two different outputs is not a function.  
* A relation in which many inputs are mapped to many outputs following no specific rule is not a function.

## **Representation of Functions**

We can define a function in mathematics as a machine that takes some input and gives a unique output. The function f(x) = x2 is defined below as,

For the above function: f(x) = x^2:

* **Input**: x: {1, 2, 3, … }  
* **Function**: Squares each input.  
* **Output**: {1, 4, 9, … } which consists of perfect squares.

## **Example of Functions**

A function in mathematics f is defined as y = f(x), where **x** is the input value, and for each input value of x, we get a unique value of y. Various examples of the functions in math defined on R→R are,

**Example 1:** y = f(x) = 3x \+ 4

*This is a **linear function**.*

* *If **x = 2**: f(2) = 3(2) \+ 4 = 6 \+ 4 = 10\. So, the output is 10\.*  
* ***Domain**: All real numbers.*  
* ***Range**: All real numbers.*
