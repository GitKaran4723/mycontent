## **1\. Introduction to Digital Computers**

A **digital computer** is an electronic machine that **processes data in discrete (digital) form**, using **binary digits (0 and 1\)**.  
 All operations inside a digital computer are performed using **binary logic**.

---

## **2\. Definition**

**Digital Computer:**  
 A computer that represents and processes all data and instructions using **binary numbers (0 and 1\)** and performs operations based on **digital logic circuits**.

---

## **3\. Basic Characteristics of Digital Computers**

1. **Binary Operation**

   * Works only with **0 and 1**

   * Data is represented in binary form

2. **High Speed**

   * Performs millions or billions of operations per second

3. **Accuracy**

   * Produces accurate results if input and program are correct

4. **Reliability**

   * Same input always produces same output

5. **Programmability**

   * Can be programmed to perform different tasks

6. **Automation**

   * Works automatically once instructions are given

7. **Storage Capability**

   * Stores large amounts of data and programs

## **4\. Functional Units of a Digital Computer**

A digital computer is divided into **five major functional units**.

---

### **4.1 Input Unit**

#### **Function:**

* Accepts data and instructions from the user

* Converts them into **binary form**

#### **Examples:**

* Keyboard

* Mouse

* Scanner

* Barcode reader

---

### **4.2 Output Unit**

#### **Function:**

* Converts processed binary data into **human-readable form**

#### **Examples:**

* Monitor

* Printer

* Speakers

* Plotter

---

### **4.3 Memory Unit (Storage Unit)**

Stores:

* Data

* Instructions

* Intermediate results

* Final output

#### **Types of Memory:**

##### **(a) Primary Memory**

* RAM (Random Access Memory)

* ROM (Read Only Memory)

* Cache Memory

##### **(b) Secondary Memory**

* Hard Disk

* SSD

* CD/DVD

* Pen Drive

---

### **4.4 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

#### **Function:**

* Performs:

  * Arithmetic operations: \+, −, ×, ÷

  * Logical operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR

* Uses **digital circuits** like adders and logic gates

---

### **4.5 Control Unit (CU)**

#### **Function:**

* Controls and coordinates all operations

* Fetches instructions from memory

* Decodes instructions

* Directs ALU and memory

---

### **4.6 Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

CPU = **ALU \+ Control Unit \+ Registers**

* Heart of the digital computer

* Performs all processing tasks

---

## **5\. Working Principle of a Digital Computer**

Digital computers work on the **Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle**.

### **Steps:**

1. **Fetch**

   * Instruction fetched from memory

2. **Decode**

   * Control unit interprets the instruction

3. **Execute**

   * ALU performs operation

   * Result stored in memory

This cycle repeats continuously.

## **6\. Data Representation in Digital Computers**

* Numbers → Binary

* Characters → ASCII / Unicode

* Images → Pixels (binary values)

* Sound → Digital samples

---

## **7\. Classification of Digital Computers**

---

   * Used in banks, airlines

3. **Minicomputers**

   * Medium-sized (mostly obsolete)

4. **Microcomputers**

   * Personal computers

   * Desktops, laptops, tablets

---

### **7.2 Based on Purpose**

1. **General-Purpose Computers**
