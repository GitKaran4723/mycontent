## **Decoder – 3-to-8 Line Decoder** 

---

### **1\. What is a Decoder?**

A **decoder** is a **combinational logic circuit** that converts **binary input signals into a unique output line**.

* For **n input lines**, there are **2ⁿ output lines**.

* Only **one output** is HIGH at a time corresponding to the binary input, all others remain LOW.

* Decoders are often called **“binary to one-of-many” decoders**.

**Purpose:**

* Identify a binary combination

* Select a device or memory location

* Enable specific circuits in digital electronics

### **2\. 3-to-8 Line Decoder – Definition**

A **3-to-8 line decoder** is a digital circuit with:

* **3 input lines**: A, B, C

* **8 output lines**: Y₀ to Y₇

It activates **only one output** based on the **binary value of the 3 inputs**.

* Since 2³ = 8, it produces 8 outputs from 3 inputs.

* Optional **Enable (E)** input: When E = 1, decoder works; when E = 0, all outputs are disabled.

### **3\. Truth Table of 3-to-8 Line Decoder**

<pre>
| A | B | C | Y0 | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 | Y6 | Y7 |
|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
</pre>

### **4\. Boolean Expressions for Outputs**

Each output can be written as a **product (AND) of inputs and/or their complements**:

| Output | Expression |
| ----- | ----- |
| Y₀ | A'B'C' |
| Y₁ | A'B'C |
| Y₂ | A'BC' |
| Y₃ | A'BC |
| Y₄ | AB'C' |
| Y₅ | AB'C |
| Y₆ | ABC' |
| Y₇ | ABC |

Where **A, B, C** are inputs, and **'** denotes NOT (complement).

---

### **5\. Enable Input (Optional)**

* Enable input **E** acts as a master control:

  * If E = 1 → decoder outputs function normally

  * If E = 0 → all outputs are LOW

* Expression with enable: **Y₀ = E·A'·B'·C'**, **Y₁ = E·A'·B'·C**, etc.

### **6\. Applications of 3-to-8 Line Decoder**

1. **Memory Addressing:** Select one memory location out of 8 (or more with cascading).

2. **Data Routing:** Activate only one device (LED, relay, etc.) at a time.

3. **Demultiplexing:** Acts as a **1-to-8 demultiplexer** for digital signals.

4. **Code Conversion:** Convert binary input to **one-of-many output format**.

5. **Control Circuits:** Enable or disable specific circuits in digital systems.

---

### **7\. Advantages of 3-to-8 Decoder**

* Simple design using AND and NOT gates

* Only one output active at a time → avoids conflicts

* Can be cascaded to generate more outputs (e.g., 4-to-16)

---

### **8\. Summary**

* A **3-to-8 line decoder** is a **combinational circuit** with 3 inputs and 8 outputs.

* For each input combination, **exactly one output is HIGH**.

* Outputs are generated using **AND gates and complements of inputs**.

* Widely used in **memory selection, demultiplexing, and digital control systems**.
