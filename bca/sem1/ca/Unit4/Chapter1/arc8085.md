# **8085 Assembly Language Programming** 

---

## **1\. Introduction**

**8085 Assembly Language** is a **low-level programming language** for the **Intel 8085 microprocessor**.

* It allows **direct control of the CPU and hardware** using **mnemonics** instead of binary codes.

* Each **assembly instruction corresponds to a machine instruction**, making it easier for humans to program than raw machine code.

* Assembly language programming is **hardware-specific** and is used for **system programming, embedded systems, and device control**.

**Key Concept:**

“Assembly language is a human-readable form of machine language that uses mnemonics and symbolic addresses to program a microprocessor.”

## **2\. Basics of 8085 Microprocessor**

Before programming, understand the **key components of 8085**:

* **Registers:** A, B, C, D, E, H, L (Accumulator is A)

* **Program Counter (PC):** Points to next instruction

* **Stack Pointer (SP):** Points to stack in memory

* **Flags:** Z (Zero), S (Sign), CY (Carry), P (Parity), AC (Auxiliary Carry)

* **Memory:** 64 KB addressable space

---

## **3\. Features of 8085 Assembly Language**

1. **Mnemonics:** Short codes for instructions, e.g.,

   * `MOV` – Move data

   * `ADD` – Add contents

   * `JMP` – Jump to address

2. **Operands:** Registers, memory locations, or immediate data

3. **Labels:** Symbolic names for memory addresses

4. **Comments:** Use `;` for comments to describe code

5. **Instruction Types:**

## **4\. Classification of 8085 Instructions**

8085 instructions are broadly classified into:

| Instruction Type | Purpose | Examples |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Data Transfer** | Move data between registers, memory, and I/O | `MOV A, B`, `LDA 2000H`, `STA 3000H`, `IN 01H`, `OUT 02H` |
| **Arithmetic** | Perform addition, subtraction, increment, decrement | `ADD B`, `SUB C`, `INR D`, `DCR E` |
| **Logical** | Perform AND, OR, XOR, NOT, compare | `ANA B`, `XRA A`, `CPI 55H`, `CMP C` |
| **Branch / Program Control** | Alter program flow (jump, call, return) | `JMP 2050H`, `JC 3000H`, `CALL 4000H`, `RET` |
| **Stack Operations** | Push and pop data to/from stack | `PUSH B`, `POP D` |
| **Machine Control** | Control CPU operations | `NOP`, `HLT`, `DI`, `EI` |

## **5\. Syntax of 8085 Assembly Language Program**

A typical 8085 assembly program has three main sections:

**Header / Origin Statement:**

 `ORG 2000H   ; Set starting address of the program`

1. 

**Code / Instructions:**

 `MVI A, 05H  ; Load 5 into accumulator`  
`ADD B       ; Add B to accumulator`  
`STA 3000H   ; Store result in memory location 3000H`

2. 

**End Statement:**

 `HLT         ; Halt the program`

3. 

**Basic Format:**

`[Label]  Mnemonic  Operand(s)   ; Comment`

* **Label:** Optional symbolic name

* **Mnemonic:** Instruction code

* **Operand(s):** Register, memory, or data

* **Comment:** Explains instruction

---

## **6\. Addressing Modes in 8085**

8085 uses different **addressing modes** for instructions:

**Immediate Addressing:** Operand is part of instruction

 `MVI A, 25H   ; Load 25H into accumulator`

1. 

**Register Addressing:** Operand is a CPU register

 `MOV B, C     ; Copy contents of C into B`

2. 

**Direct Addressing:** Operand is a memory location

 `LDA 2050H    ; Load accumulator from memory 2050H`

3. 

**Indirect Addressing:** Operand is memory pointed by register pair

 `LDAX B       ; Load accumulator from memory address in BC pair`

4. 

**Implied / Implicit Addressing:** Operand is implied by instruction

 `CMA          ; Complement accumulator`  
`RAL          ; Rotate accumulator left`

5.

## **7\. Writing an 8085 Assembly Program – Example**

**Problem:** Add two numbers stored in memory locations 2000H and 2001H and store result at 2002H

**Program:**

`ORG 2000H      ; Start address`

`LDA 2000H      ; Load first number into accumulator`  
`ADD 2001H      ; Add second number to accumulator`  
`STA 2002H      ; Store result at 2002H`  
`HLT            ; Stop program`

**Explanation:**

1. `LDA 2000H` → Load number from memory 2000H into accumulator

2. `ADD 2001H` → Add number from memory 2001H to accumulator

3. `STA 2002H` → Store result into memory 2002H

4. `HLT` → Stop execution

## **8\. Debugging & Execution**

* Use **simulators or 8085 trainer kits** to run programs

* Check **register values, memory content, and flags** after execution

* Assembly programs require **careful memory management and instruction sequencing**

---

## **9\. Summary**

* **8085 Assembly Language** is a low-level programming language using mnemonics.

* Instructions control **data transfer, arithmetic, logic, branching, stack, and CPU operations**.

* Programs have **origin, code, and halt sections**.

* Knowledge of **registers, memory, addressing modes, and flags** is essential.

* Example programs involve **loading, adding, storing, and halting operations**.

## **3\. Major Components of 8085**

### **3.1 Accumulator (A Register)**

* **Primary 8-bit register** in the 8085 CPU.

* Used to store **data for arithmetic and logical operations**.

* Performs **logic operations**: AND, OR, XOR, Compare (CMP), Rotate

* Works closely with **Accumulator** for operations

---

### **3.4 Flags Register**

* 8-bit register, but only **5 bits are used** as flags:

| Flag | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **S (Sign)** | Set if result is negative (MSB = 1\) |
| **Z (Zero)** | Set if result = 0 |
| **AC (Auxiliary Carry)** | Set if carry from bit 3 to 4 in BCD operations |
| **P (Parity)** | Set if result has even parity |
| **CY (Carry)** | Set if there is a carry out from MSB |

*   
  Flags are **used for conditional operations**.

---

### **3.5 Program Counter (PC)**

* Automatically **increments after each instruction fetch**.

---

### **3.6 Stack Pointer (SP)**

* **16-bit register** that stores the **address of the top of the stack** in memory.

* Used for **stack operations**: PUSH, POP, CALL, RETURN.

---

### **3.7 Instruction Register and Decoder**

* **Instruction Register (IR):** Holds the **current instruction** fetched from memory

* **Instruction Decoder:** Decodes the instruction and generates **control signals** to execute it

---

### **3.8 Control and Timing Unit**

* Generates **timing and control signals** for data transfer and execution.

* Manages **Read/Write signals, Memory/IO control, and Clock pulses**.

**Control signals include:**

* **Address Bus (16-bit):** Selects memory or I/O location

* **Data Bus (8-bit):** Transfers data between CPU, memory, and I/O

* **Control Bus:** Sends control signals for read/write and timing

---

## **4\. Working of 8085 Architecture**

1. **Fetch Cycle**

   * PC provides address of instruction → instruction fetched from memory → stored in Instruction Register

2. **Decode Cycle**

   * Instruction is decoded by Instruction Decoder → control signals are generated

3. **Execute Cycle**

   * ALU performs arithmetic/logic operations

   * Data may be transferred between registers/memory/I/O

4. **Program Flow Control**

   * PC increments or branches based on instruction

   * Flags may affect conditional execution

---

## **5\. Summary**

* The 8085 microprocessor architecture includes **Accumulator, General Registers, ALU, Flags, Program Counter, Stack Pointer, Instruction Decoder, Control Unit, and System Bus**.

* Works by **fetching, decoding, and executing instructions**, transferring data between **CPU, memory, and I/O devices**.

* **Registers, ALU, and flags** form the core processing unit, while **control and timing unit** ensures proper execution and synchronization.
