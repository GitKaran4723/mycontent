# **8085 Programming Model** 

---

## **1\. Introduction**

The **8085 programming model** is an **internal representation of the microprocessor’s registers and flags** used to execute instructions.

* It is **not a physical diagram** like the architecture, but a **conceptual model** for understanding **how programs use CPU resources**.

* It helps programmers understand **data storage, processing, and control flow**.

**Key Idea:**

“The programming model shows which registers, flags, and pointers are available to the programmer for writing 8085 assembly programs.”

---

## **2\. Components of the 8085 Programming Model**

The 8085 programming model consists of **registers, accumulator, flag register, program counter, and stack pointer**.

---

### **2.1 Accumulator (A)**

* **8-bit register** used to store **operands and results** of arithmetic and logical operations.

* Works directly with the **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**.

* Most **arithmetic, logic, and data transfer instructions** involve the accumulator.

**Example:**

`ADD B    ; Add contents of B to accumulator`

---

### **2.2 General Purpose Registers (B, C, D, E, H, L)**

* **Six 8-bit registers** used for **temporary data storage**.

* Can be used individually or as **register pairs** for **16-bit operations**.

| Register Pair | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| B-C | Often used for 16-bit data manipulation or memory addressing |
| D-E | Another pair for 16-bit operations |
| H-L | Often used as a **memory pointer** (holds address for memory read/write) |

**Example:**

`MOV M, A   ; Store accumulator contents into memory location pointed by H-L`

---

### **2.3 Flag Register**

* **8-bit register**, but only **5 bits are used as flags**:

| Flag | Function |
| ----- | ----- |
| **S (Sign)** | Set if result of operation is negative (MSB = 1\) |
| **Z (Zero)** | Set if result = 0 |
| **AC (Auxiliary Carry)** | Set if carry from bit 3 to 4 (used in BCD operations) |
| **P (Parity)** | Set if result has even parity |
| **CY (Carry)** | Set if carry out from most significant bit |

**Flags are updated automatically** by arithmetic and logical instructions and **used in conditional instructions** like `JZ`, `JC`, etc.

---

### **2.4 Program Counter (PC)**

* **16-bit register** pointing to **address of next instruction**.

* **Automatically increments** after each instruction fetch.

* **Cannot be directly modified by most instructions**, except for jump or call instructions.

**Example:**

`JMP 2050H   ; Program counter is loaded with 2050H`

---

### **2.5 Stack Pointer (SP)**

* **16-bit register** pointing to the **top of the stack in memory**.

* Used for **temporary storage of return addresses or data**.

* Stack grows **downwards** (from higher memory to lower memory).

**Example:**

`PUSH B    ; Store B-C register pair on stack`  
`POP D     ; Retrieve value from stack into D-E pair`

---

### **2.6 Instruction Register (IR) and Decoder**

* **Instruction Register** holds the **currently executing instruction** fetched from memory.

* **Instruction Decoder** decodes the instruction and generates **control signals** to execute it.

**Note:** These are **internal CPU elements** and are part of the programming model conceptually.

---

### **2.7 Temporary Register (TMP)**

* **Used internally by the ALU** during operations.

* Helps in **intermediate computations**, not directly accessible to programmer.

---

### **2.8 Memory Address Register (MAR) and Memory Buffer Register (MBR)**

* **MAR:** Holds the memory address to be accessed (read/write).

* **MBR:** Holds the data read from or to be written to memory.

**Note:** These are **conceptual internal registers**, part of the programming model for understanding memory access.

---

## **3\. Working of the 8085 Programming Model**

1. **Instruction Fetch:**

   * PC points to memory location → instruction fetched into IR → PC increments

2. **Instruction Decode:**

   * Instruction decoded by decoder → control signals generated

3. **Operand Fetch/Execution:**

   * ALU performs arithmetic/logic operations

   * Accumulator stores result

   * Flags updated accordingly

4. **Memory/Stack Operations:**

   * H-L register pair can point to memory

   * SP points to stack top for push/pop operations

5. **Program Control:**

   * Jumps, calls, and returns modify PC

   * Flags control conditional operations

## **4\. Summary of 8085 Programming Model**

| Component | Type | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Accumulator (A) | 8-bit | Stores operands/results for ALU operations |
| General Registers (B, C, D, E, H, L) | 8-bit each | Temporary storage; H-L used as memory pointer |
| Flags | 5 bits | Indicate result status (S, Z, AC, P, CY) |
| Program Counter (PC) | 16-bit | Holds address of next instruction |
| Stack Pointer (SP) | 16-bit | Points to top of stack in memory |
| Instruction Register (IR) | 8-bit | Holds current instruction |
| Temporary/Internal Registers | 8-bit | Intermediate data storage for ALU/memory operations |

## **5\. Importance of Programming Model**

* Helps **write efficient assembly programs** by understanding available registers and flags.

* Allows **managing data, memory, and stack operations** effectively.

* Provides a **clear structure for instruction execution, flag usage, and program flow**.
