# **8085 Microprocessor Pin Configuration** 

---

## **1\. Introduction**

The **Intel 8085 microprocessor** is a **40-pin IC** that interfaces with memory and I/O devices.

* It uses a **8-bit data bus** and **16-bit address bus**.

* Pins are classified into **Power, Address/Data, Control, Status, Clock, and Interrupt/Control signals**.

**Key Idea:**

“Each pin has a specific function for data transfer, addressing, control, or interfacing with external devices.”

## **2\. Pin Classification**

The **40 pins** of 8085 can be divided into the following groups:

| Group | Pins | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Power | Vcc, GND | Power supply (+5V) and ground |
| Address/Data Bus | AD0–AD7, A8–A15 | Address/Data multiplexed (AD0–AD7) & high-order address lines (A8–A15) |
| Control & Status | ALE, RD, WR, IO/M, S0, S1 | Memory/IO control and status signals |
| Stack/Program Control | RESET IN, RESET OUT, HOLD, HLDA | CPU control signals for reset and bus control |
| Interrupts | INTR, RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, TRAP | Hardware interrupts |
| Serial I/O | SID, SOD | Serial input/output |
| Clock | X1, X2, CLK OUT | Clock signals for CPU timing |

## **3\. Detailed Pin Description**

### **3.1 Power Pins**

| Pin | Name | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 40 | **Vcc** | \+5V power supply |
| 20 | **GND** | Ground |

---

### **3.2 Address/Data Bus Pins**

* **AD0 – AD7 (Pins 12–19)**

  * **Multiplexed lower-order address/data bus**

  * During **first clock cycle**, acts as **address bus (A0–A7)**

  * During **data transfer**, acts as **data bus (D0–D7)**

* **A8 – A15 (Pins 21–28)**

  * **High-order address bus** (always address)

  * Used to access memory locations (8-bit high address)

* **ALE (Pin 30\)** – Address Latch Enable

  * Enables external **latch to separate lower-order address and data**

  * High pulse indicates **address is available on AD0–AD7**

### **3.3 Control and Status Signals**

| Pin | Name | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 32 | **RD (Read)** | Active-low signal. CPU reads data from memory or I/O |
| 31 | **WR (Write)** | Active-low signal. CPU writes data to memory or I/O |
| 34 | **IO/M** | High → I/O operation, Low → Memory operation |
| 35 | **S1**, 36 | **S0** |

**Note:** S1 and S0 are mainly for **internal decoding and control bus indication**.

### **3.4 Stack/Program Control Pins**

| Pin | Name | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 36 | **RESET IN** | Active-high input. Resets program counter to 0000H |
| 36 | **RESET OUT** | Active-high output. Indicates reset to peripheral devices |
| 39 | **HOLD** | Indicates external device requests CPU bus control |
| 38 | **HLDA** | CPU acknowledges HOLD signal (High when bus released) |

---

### **3.5 Interrupt Pins**

8085 has **five interrupt pins**, used to pause CPU and execute service routine:

| Pin | Name | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 4 | **TRAP** | Non-maskable | Highest priority, edge & level triggered |
| 5 | **RST7.5** | Maskable | Highest priority among maskable, edge-triggered |
| 6 | **RST6.5** | Maskable | Level-triggered |
| 7 | **RST5.5** | Maskable | Level-triggered |
| 8 | **INTR** | Maskable | General-purpose interrupt, CPU polls it |

---

### **3.6 Serial I/O Pins**

| Pin | Name | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | **SID** | Serial Input Data (for serial communication) |
| 2 | **SOD** | Serial Output Data |

---

### **3.7 Clock Pins**

| Pin | Name | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1,2 | **X1, X2** | Connected to crystal oscillator for clock generation |
| 3 | **CLK OUT** | Provides clock output signal for other devices |

### **3.8 Summary of Pin Functions**

1. **Power Supply:** Vcc (Pin 40), GND (Pin 20\)

2. **Address/Data Bus:** AD0–AD7 (lower), A8–A15 (higher), ALE (Address latch enable)

3. **Control/Status:** RD, WR, IO/M, S0, S1

4. **Stack/Program Control:** RESET IN, RESET OUT, HOLD, HLDA

5. **Interrupts:** TRAP, RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, INTR

6. **Serial I/O:** SID, SOD

7. **Clock:** X1, X2, CLK OUT

## **4\. Working of 8085 Pins**

1. **Addressing Memory:**

   * AD0–AD7 \+ A8–A15 carry 16-bit address.

   * ALE latches lower-order address to external latch.

2. **Data Transfer:**

   * RD and WR signals control reading and writing of data.

   * Data flows through AD0–AD7.

3. **Interrupt Handling:**

   * CPU suspends normal execution when an interrupt is triggered.

   * CPU jumps to **predefined memory location** to execute ISR.

4. **Control & Timing:**

   * Clock pins (X1, X2) provide timing.

   * Control signals manage bus, I/O, and memory operations.

---

## **5\. Summary**

* 8085 has **40 pins** divided into **power, address/data bus, control, stack, interrupt, serial I/O, and clock**.

* **Multiplexed AD0–AD7 pins** reduce the number of pins needed.

* **Control signals** like ALE, RD, WR, and IO/M help manage memory and I/O operations.

* **Interrupt pins** provide CPU with priority-based hardware interrupts.

* Proper understanding of pins is essential for **hardware interfacing and assembly programming**.
