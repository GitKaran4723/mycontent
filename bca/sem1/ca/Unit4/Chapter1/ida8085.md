# **Instruction, Data Formats, and Storage in 8085 Microprocessor** 

---

## **1\. Introduction**

The **8085 microprocessor** works by executing instructions stored in **memory**.

* **Instruction formats** define how instructions are stored in memory.

* **Data formats** define how numerical or character data is represented.

* **Storage** refers to **memory locations used for instructions and data**.

Understanding these concepts is **essential for programming and designing systems with 8085**.

## **2\. Instruction Formats**

An **instruction** is a command given to the microprocessor to perform a specific operation.

* Every instruction has **two main parts**:

1. **Opcode (Operation Code)** – Specifies the operation to perform.

2. **Operand** – Specifies the data, register, or memory address for the operation.

**Instruction formats vary based on the number of bytes and operands.**

---

### **2.1 Types of Instruction Formats in 8085**

1. **1-Byte Instructions**

   * Only **opcode** is stored.

   * No operand, or the operand is implicit (inside CPU).

   * **Memory required:** 1 byte

   * **Example:**

     * `CMA` – Complement Accumulator

     * `RAL` – Rotate Accumulator Left

2. **2-Byte Instructions**

   * Opcode \+ **8-bit data or 8-bit memory address**

   * **Memory required:** 2 bytes

   * **Example:**

     * `MVI A, 55H` – Move 8-bit immediate data into A

     * `IN 01H` – Input from port 01H

3. **3-Byte Instructions**

   * Opcode \+ **16-bit memory address or data**

   * **Memory required:** 3 bytes

   * **Example:**

     * `LDA 2050H` – Load accumulator from memory address 2050H

     * `JMP 3000H` – Jump to memory location 3000H

**Summary Table:**

| Instruction Size | Content | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 byte | Opcode only | CMA, NOP, RAL |
| 2 bytes | Opcode \+ 8-bit data/address | MVI A, 55H; IN 01H |
| 3 bytes | Opcode \+ 16-bit address | LDA 2050H; JMP 3000H |

### **2.2 Operand Types**

* **Immediate:** Operand is part of instruction (MVI, ADI)

* **Register:** Operand is a CPU register (ADD B, MOV A,B)

* **Memory:** Operand is stored in memory (LDA, STA)

* **I/O Port:** Operand is an input/output port (IN, OUT)

## **3\. Data Formats in 8085**

**8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor**, so data is handled in **8-bit or 16-bit formats**.

### **3.1 8-bit Data Format**

* **Range:** 0 to 255 (unsigned) or \-128 to 127 (signed, two’s complement)

* **Usage:**

  * Stored in registers (A, B, C, D, E, H, L)

  * Used in arithmetic/logic operations

**Example:**

`MVI A, 25H  ; Load 25H into accumulator`

### **3.2 16-bit Data Format**

* **Range:** 0 to 65535 (unsigned)

* Represented using **register pairs** (B-C, D-E, H-L) or memory locations.

* Used for **addresses, counters, and 16-bit arithmetic operations**.

**Example:**

`LXI H, 2050H  ; Load H-L pair with 16-bit address 2050H`

### **3.3 Data Representation**

1. **Binary:** 0s and 1s, basic CPU representation

2. **Hexadecimal:** Human-friendly representation of bytes (0–FFH for 8-bit, 0000–FFFFH for 16-bit)

3. **Decimal:** Usually for programming logic

4. **ASCII:** Character data stored as 8-bit codes

---

## **4\. Storage in 8085**

Memory is used to **store both instructions and data**.

* **8085 can address up to 64 KB memory** (16-bit address bus).

* Memory is organized as **linear array of 8-bit bytes**.

### **4.1 Memory for Instructions**

* Instructions are stored in **consecutive memory locations**.

* Instruction size determines how many memory bytes are occupied.

  * **1-byte instruction:** 1 memory location

  * **2-byte instruction:** 2 memory locations

  * **3-byte instruction:** 3 memory locations

**Example:**

`Address  Instruction`  
`2000H    MVI A, 55H   ; 2 bytes: 2000H = opcode, 2001H = data`  
`2002H    ADD B        ; 1 byte`  
`2003H    JMP 2050H    ; 3 bytes: 2003H = opcode, 2004H & 2005H = address`

### **4.2 Memory for Data**

* **Data can be stored in registers or memory locations.**

* **Registers:** Fast, temporary storage (volatile)

* **Memory:** Permanent storage for variables or program constants

**Example:**

`2050H    0A           ; Data stored in memory location 2050H`  
`2051H    14`

### **4.3 Addressing Modes in Storage**

* **Direct Addressing:** Memory address is given in instruction (LDA 2050H)

* **Indirect Addressing:** Memory address stored in register pair (MOV A, M)

* **Immediate Addressing:** Data is part of instruction (MVI A, 55H)

## **5\. Summary**

1. **Instruction Format:**

   * 1-byte, 2-byte, 3-byte based on opcode and operand size

   * Specifies operation type and operand(s)

2. **Data Format:**

   * 8-bit for registers, 16-bit for addresses

   * Represented in binary, hex, decimal, or ASCII

3. **Storage:**

   * Memory stores both instructions and data

   * Registers store temporary data

   * Proper understanding helps in **writing efficient programs**
