# **Logical Operations in 8085 Microprocessor**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

**Logical operations** in 8085 are used to **manipulate individual bits or groups of bits** in the accumulator or registers. These operations do **not involve arithmetic calculations** but are essential for **bitwise processing, testing, and data comparison**.

**Purpose:**

To perform **bitwise AND, OR, XOR, complement, rotate, and compare operations** on data.

**Flags Affected:**

* **Sign (S)** – 1 if result is negative, 0 if positive

* **Zero (Z)** – 1 if result is 0

* **Parity (P)** – 1 if even parity, 0 if odd parity

* **Carry (CY)** – Only affected by some rotate operations

* **Auxiliary Carry (AC)** – Usually not affected

---

## **2\. Categories of Logical Operations**

Logical operations in 8085 can be divided into **5 main categories**:

1. **Logical AND**

2. **Logical OR**

3. **Logical XOR (Exclusive OR)**

4. **Complement / Compare Operations**

5. **Rotate Operations**

## **3\. Detailed Explanation of Each Type**

### **3.1 Logical AND Operations**

* Performs **bitwise AND** between the **accumulator** and another register or memory.

* **Result stored in accumulator**.

* **Flags affected:** S, Z, P; CY is reset.

**Instructions:**

| Instruction | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `ANA R` | Accumulator AND register R |
| `ANI data` | Accumulator AND immediate data |
| `ANI M` | Accumulator AND memory (pointed by H-L) |

**Example:**

`MVI A, 5AH   ; A = 01011010`  
`MVI B, 3CH   ; B = 00111100`  
`ANA B        ; A = A & B = 00011000`

---

### **3.2 Logical OR Operations**

* Performs **bitwise OR** between accumulator and another register or memory.

* **Result stored in accumulator**.

* **Flags affected:** S, Z, P; CY is reset.

**Instructions:**

| Instruction | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `ORA R` | Accumulator OR register R |
| `ORI data` | Accumulator OR immediate data |
| `ORA M` | Accumulator OR memory (H-L) |

**Example:**

`MVI A, 5AH   ; 01011010`  
`MVI B, 3CH   ; 00111100`  
`ORA B        ; 01111110`

---

### **3.3 Logical XOR (Exclusive OR) Operations**

* Performs **bitwise XOR** between accumulator and another register or memory.

* **Result stored in accumulator**.

* **Flags affected:** S, Z, P; CY is reset.

**Instructions:**

| Instruction | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `XRA R` | Accumulator XOR register R |
| `XRI data` | Accumulator XOR immediate data |
| `XRA M` | Accumulator XOR memory (H-L) |

**Example:**

`MVI A, 5AH   ; 01011010`  
`MVI B, 3CH   ; 00111100`  
`XRA B        ; 01100110`

---

### **3.4 Complement / Compare Operations**

1. **Complement Accumulator (`CMA`)**

   * Flips all bits in the accumulator (1→0, 0→1).

   * Flags: None affected.

Example:

 `MVI A, 5AH  ; 01011010`  
`CMA          ; 10100101`

*   
2. **Compare (`CMP`)**

   * Compares **accumulator with a register, memory, or immediate data** by subtracting operand from accumulator (A – operand).

   * **Result not stored**, only **flags updated** (S, Z, P, CY, AC).

   * Instructions: `CMP R`, `CPI data`, `CMP M`

Example:

 `MVI A, 50H`  
`MVI B, 30H`  
`CMP B       ; A-B = 50H-30H; Z=0, CY=0, S=0`

*

### **3.5 Rotate Operations**

Rotate instructions **move bits within the accumulator**:

| Instruction | Description | Carry Impact |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `RLC` | Rotate accumulator left (MSB → LSB & CY) | CY = MSB |
| `RRC` | Rotate accumulator right (LSB → MSB & CY) | CY = LSB |
| `RAL` | Rotate accumulator left through carry | CY = old MSB |
| `RAR` | Rotate accumulator right through carry | CY = old LSB |

**Example:**

`MVI A, 85H   ; 10000101`  
`RLC          ; A = 00001011, CY=1`

---

## **4\. Logical Operations Using Memory**

* The **memory location addressed by H-L pair** can be used for logical operations.

* Example:

`ANA M     ; A = A & (memory content pointed by H-L)`  
`ORA M     ; A = A | (memory content pointed by H-L)`  
`XRA M     ; A = A ^ (memory content pointed by H-L)`

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ANA R | AND accumulator with register | R | `ANA B` |
| ANI data | AND accumulator with immediate | data | `ANI 55H` |
| ANA M | AND accumulator with memory | M | `ANA M` |

## **6\. Key Points**

1. Logical operations are **mainly accumulator-based**.

2. Flags are updated based on **result** (S, Z, P), except rotate instructions which also affect CY.

3. Memory content can be accessed indirectly using **H-L pair**.

4. **Compare operations** do not store result; they only update flags for **conditional branching**.

5. Complement and rotate operations are often used for **bit manipulation in embedded programming**.
