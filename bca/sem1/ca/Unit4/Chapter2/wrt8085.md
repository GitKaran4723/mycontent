# **Writing Assembly Language Programs for 8085**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

**Assembly language** is a **low-level programming language** that uses **mnemonics** (short symbolic codes) instead of binary machine code.

* Each assembly instruction corresponds to **one machine instruction**.

* Programs written in assembly are **hardware-specific** but are **easier to read than pure machine code**.

**Purpose:**

To instruct the microprocessor to perform operations such as arithmetic, logical, data transfer, and control operations.

## **2\. Steps in Writing an Assembly Language Program**

Writing an assembly language program involves **five main steps**:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* Read and analyze the **problem statement**.

* Identify **inputs**, **outputs**, and **operations required**.

* Example:

“Add two numbers stored in memory locations 2050H and 2051H and store the result in 2052H.”

---

### **Step 2: Decide Memory and Registers**

* Choose **registers** for temporary storage (accumulator, B, C, D, E, H, L).

* Determine **memory addresses** for input and output data.

* Example:

`2050H → First number`  
`2051H → Second number`  
`2052H → Result`

---

### **Step 3: Write the Algorithm**

* **Algorithm** is a step-by-step plan for solving the problem.

* Example:

1. Load first number from memory into accumulator.

2. Add second number to accumulator.

3. Store result in memory.

---

### **Step 4: Write the Assembly Language Program**

* Convert the **algorithm** into **8085 mnemonics**.

* Use proper instructions for **data transfer, arithmetic, logical, and control operations**.

* Example:

`LDA 2050H   ; Load first number into accumulator`  
`ADD 2051H   ; Add second number to accumulator`  
`STA 2052H   ; Store result in memory`  
`HLT         ; Stop program`

---

### **Step 5: Assemble, Load, and Execute**

1. **Assemble:**

   * Convert assembly mnemonics into **machine code** using an assembler.

2. **Load:**

   * Place machine code into **memory addresses** for execution.

3. **Execute:**

   * Run the program using the **microprocessor simulator or actual hardware**.

   * Monitor **registers, memory, and flags** to ensure correct results.

---

## **3\. Structure of an 8085 Assembly Language Program**

An assembly program typically contains:

1. **Title / Comment Section**

   * Describes program purpose.

   * Begins with `;` for comments.

Example:

 `; Program to Add Two Numbers`

*   
2. **Declaration / Data Section**

   * Define memory locations for variables (optional in some assemblers).

Example:

 `NUM1: DB 25H`  
`NUM2: DB 30H`  
`RESULT: DS 1`

*   
3. **Code Section**

   * Sequence of assembly instructions.

Example:

 `LDA NUM1`  
`ADD NUM2`  
`STA RESULT`  
`HLT`

*   
4. **End Statement**

   * Marks **end of program** (some assemblers use `END`).

## **4\. Rules for Writing 8085 Assembly Language Programs**

1. Each instruction must have **mnemonic** (like `LDA`, `MOV`, `ADD`).

2. **Operands** (registers, memory, immediate data) must be valid.

3. Use **comments** to explain each instruction.

4. Memory addresses must be **hexadecimal (H)**.

5. Always **end program with HLT** to stop execution.

---

## **5\. Common Types of Programs**

8085 assembly programs can be broadly classified as:

| Program Type | Examples |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Data Transfer** | Copy data from one memory location to another |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Addition, subtraction, increment, decrement |
| **Logical Operations** | AND, OR, XOR, complement |
| **Branching** | Conditional or unconditional jumps |
| **Stack Operations** | PUSH, POP, subroutine calls |
| **I/O Operations** | Reading input or writing output to ports |

---

## **6\. Example Program: Add Two Numbers**

**Problem:** Add 25H and 30H and store the result in 2052H.

**Solution:**

`; Program to Add Two Numbers in 8085`  
`MVI A, 25H    ; Load 25H into accumulator`  
`ADI 30H       ; Add 30H to accumulator`  
`STA 2052H     ; Store result in memory 2052H`  
`HLT           ; Stop execution`

**Execution Steps:**

| Step | Instruction | Operation | Accumulator |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | MVI A,25H | A = 25H | 25H |
| 2 | ADI 30H | A = A \+ 30H | 55H |
| 3 | STA 2052H | Store A in 2052H | 55H |
| 4 | HLT | Stop program | — |

## **7\. Tips for Writing Efficient Programs**

1. Use **registers for temporary storage** instead of memory (faster).

2. Minimize number of instructions by **using accumulator wisely**.

3. Always **comment** your code.

4. Break **complex operations into subroutines** for reuse.

5. Verify **flags** if program involves conditional branching.
