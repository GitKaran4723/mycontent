# **Addressing Modes in 8085**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

**Addressing mode** refers to the way **an instruction specifies the location of its operand** (data to be operated on).

* In 8085, operands can be **in registers, memory, or provided as immediate data**.

* Addressing mode determines **how the CPU accesses the operand**.

**Importance:**

Understanding addressing modes is crucial for writing efficient programs and knowing how instructions fetch and use data.

## **2\. Types of Addressing Modes in 8085**

8085 supports **five main addressing modes**:

1. **Immediate Addressing**

2. **Register Addressing**

3. **Direct Addressing**

4. **Indirect Addressing**

5. **Implicit (Implied) Addressing**

---

## **3\. Detailed Explanation of Each Addressing Mode**

---

### **3.1 Immediate Addressing Mode**

* The **operand is specified directly in the instruction itself**.

* No memory or register reference is needed to fetch the operand.

* Used for **constants** or immediate values.

**Syntax:**

`MVI A, 25H   ; Move immediate data 25H into accumulator`  
`ADI 30H      ; Add immediate data 30H to accumulator`

**Features:**

* Fast, as CPU does not fetch data from memory.

* Used in instructions like **MVI, ADI, ACI, ANI, ORI, XRI, CPI**.

---

### **3.2 Register Addressing Mode**

* The **operand is stored in a CPU register**.

* Instruction specifies **which register** contains the data.

**Syntax:**

`MOV A, B    ; Copy content of register B into accumulator A`  
`ADD C       ; Add content of register C to accumulator`

**Features:**

* Fast, as no memory access is required.

* Registers used: **A, B, C, D, E, H, L**.

* Common in arithmetic and logical operations.

---

### **3.3 Direct Addressing Mode**

* The **address of the operand in memory is specified directly** in the instruction.

* CPU fetches data from that **specific memory location**.

**Syntax:**

`LDA 2050H   ; Load accumulator with content of memory 2050H`  
`STA 3000H   ; Store accumulator into memory 3000H`

**Features:**

* Requires **16-bit memory address** in instruction.

* Useful for accessing **data stored in fixed memory locations**.

* Instructions: LDA, STA, LHLD, SHLD, JMP, CALL.

---

### **3.4 Indirect Addressing Mode**

* The **memory address of the operand is stored in a register pair** (BC, DE, or HL).

* CPU first reads the **address from the register pair** and then fetches data from that memory location.

**Syntax:**

`MOV A, M    ; Move data from memory pointed by H-L pair to accumulator`  
`ADD M       ; Add data from memory pointed by H-L to accumulator`

* Here, `M` represents the **memory location pointed by H-L pair**.

**Features:**

* Flexible, as memory address can change during execution.

* Often used in arrays or variable data storage.

---

### **3.5 Implicit (Implied) Addressing Mode**

* Operand is **implied by the instruction itself**, no operand field is required.

* Example instructions: **CMA, RLC, RRC, HLT, NOP**.

**Syntax:**

`CMA         ; Complement accumulator`  
`HLT         ; Halt the processor`

**Features:**

* No registers or memory addresses are mentioned.

* Simple instructions that act **only on accumulator or CPU internally**.

## **4\. Summary Table of Addressing Modes**

| Addressing Mode | Operand Location | Example Instruction | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Immediate | In instruction | MVI A, 25H | Operand is constant |
| Register | CPU register | MOV A, B | Operand in register |
| Direct | Memory location | LDA 2050H | Operand in memory (address specified directly) |
| Indirect | Memory via register pair | MOV A, M | Operand in memory, address in HL pair |
| Implicit | Implied by instruction | CMA, HLT | Operand not needed |

---

## **5\. Key Points**

1. **Immediate mode** is fastest because operand is part of instruction.

2. **Register mode** avoids memory access and is also fast.

3. **Direct mode** accesses fixed memory locations.

4. **Indirect mode** provides flexibility for arrays and pointers.

5. **Implicit mode** is used for accumulator-only or control operations.

6. Efficient use of **addressing modes** can reduce memory access and optimize program speed.
