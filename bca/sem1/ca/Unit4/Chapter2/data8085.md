# **Data Transfer Operations in 8085 Microprocessor**

---

## **1\. Introduction**

**Data Transfer Instructions** are used to **move data between registers, memory, and I/O ports** without altering the data.

* They **do not perform arithmetic or logical operations**.

* **Flags are generally not affected**.

* Essential for preparing **operands for arithmetic or logical operations**.

**Purpose:**

To transfer data efficiently within the microprocessor or between microprocessor and external devices.

## **2\. Types of Data Transfer Operations**

Data transfer operations in 8085 can be categorized as follows:

1. **Register-to-Register Transfer**

2. **Register-to-Memory / Memory-to-Register Transfer**

3. **Immediate Data Transfer**

4. **Memory-to-Memory Transfer (Indirect)**

5. **Stack Operations**

6. **I/O Transfers**

## **3\. Detailed Explanation of Each Type**

### **3.1 Register-to-Register Transfer**

* Moves data from one **register to another**.

* Uses **MOV instruction**.

* **Flags affected:** None

**Syntax:**

`MOV destination, source`

**Examples:**

`MOV A, B   ; Copy data from B to accumulator A`  
`MOV D, E   ; Copy data from E to D`

---

### **3.2 Register-to-Memory / Memory-to-Register Transfer**

* Uses **register pair as a memory pointer** (H-L pair).

* Memory operations use **MOV instruction with M** (M refers to memory location pointed by H-L).

**Syntax:**

`MOV A, M   ; Load accumulator from memory`  
`MOV M, B   ; Store register B into memory`

**Example:**

`HLT        ; Stop CPU temporarily (used with data transfer indirectly)`  
`MOV M, A   ; Copy accumulator A content to memory location pointed by H-L`

---

### **3.3 Immediate Data Transfer**

* Moves **data directly specified in the instruction** to a register or memory.

* Uses **MVI or LXI instructions**.

**Syntax:**

`MVI destination, data`  
`LXI register pair, 16-bit data`

**Examples:**

`MVI A, 55H   ; Load 55H into accumulator`  
`MVI B, 0AH   ; Load 0AH into register B`  
`LXI H, 2050H ; Load H-L pair with memory address 2050H`

* **LXI** is for 16-bit immediate load into register pairs (B-C, D-E, H-L).

---

### **3.4 Memory-to-Memory Transfer (Indirect Transfer)**

* 8085 **cannot move data directly from one memory location to another**.

* Must **use a register (usually accumulator)** as an intermediate.

**Steps:**

1. Load data from source memory into accumulator.

2. Store accumulator content into destination memory.

**Example:**

`LDA 2050H   ; Load accumulator from memory 2050H`  
`STA 2060H   ; Store accumulator into memory 2060H`

---

### **3.5 Stack Operations (Data Transfer via Stack)**

* Stack is **memory used for temporary storage**.

* Uses **PUSH and POP** instructions.

**Syntax:**

`PUSH register pair`  
`POP register pair`

**Example:**

`PUSH B   ; Store B-C register pair on stack`  
`POP D    ; Retrieve top of stack into D-E register pair`

* Useful in **saving temporary data or returning from subroutines**.

---

### **3.6 I/O Data Transfer**

* Moves data between microprocessor and **peripheral I/O ports**.

* Uses **IN and OUT instructions**.

**Syntax:**

`IN port      ; Read data from I/O port into accumulator`  
`OUT port     ; Send data from accumulator to I/O port`

**Example:**

`IN 01H      ; Read input from port 01H into accumulator`  
`OUT 02H     ; Send accumulator content to port 02H`

* I/O ports are **external devices connected to the CPU**, like keyboards or displays.

## **4\. Addressing Modes Used in Data Transfer**

Data transfer instructions use various **addressing modes**:

| Addressing Mode | Explanation | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Immediate** | Data is part of instruction | `MVI A, 55H` |
| **Register** | Operand is in a CPU register | `MOV A, B` |
| **Direct** | Memory address specified in instruction | `LDA 2050H` |
| **Indirect** | Memory address stored in register pair | `MOV A, M` |
| **Implied** | No operand needed; CPU knows the operation | `XCHG` |

## **5\. Summary Table of Data Transfer Instructions**

| Instruction | Function | Description | Flags Affected |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `MOV Rd, Rs` | Register → Register | Copy data from source to destination register | None |
| `MVI R, data` | Immediate → Register | Load 8-bit data into register | None |
| `LDA addr` | Memory → Accumulator | Load accumulator from memory | None |
| `STA addr` | Accumulator → Memory | Store accumulator in memory | None |
| `LHLD addr` | Memory → H-L pair | Load H-L pair from memory | None |
| `SHLD addr` | H-L pair → Memory | Store H-L pair in memory | None |
| `LXI RP, data16` | Immediate → Register Pair | Load 16-bit data into register pair | None |
| `XCHG` | Swap | Exchange D-E and H-L register pairs | None |
| `IN port` | I/O → Accumulator | Read data from I/O port | None |
| `OUT port` | Accumulator → I/O | Send data to I/O port | None |
| `PUSH RP` | Stack → Memory | Store register pair on stack | None |
| `POP RP` | Memory → Stack | Retrieve register pair from stack | None |

## **6\. Key Points**

1. **Flags:** Data transfer instructions **do not alter any flags**.

2. **Memory Use:** One memory location is usually needed for source or destination.

3. **Registers Used:** Accumulator is often used as an intermediate in memory-to-memory transfers.

4. **I/O:** IN and OUT allow communication with external devices.

5. **Stack:** PUSH and POP allow temporary storage of data.
