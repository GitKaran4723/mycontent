# **Introduction to 8085 Instructions** 

---

## **1\. What is an Instruction?**

An **instruction** is a command given to the **microprocessor (8085)** to perform a specific operation on data or control the execution of the program.

* Each instruction tells the CPU **what to do, with what data, and where to store the result**.

* Instructions are stored in **memory in binary format (machine code)**.

* A **human-readable form** of instructions is called **assembly language**.

**Example:**

* `ADD B` → Adds the content of register B to the accumulator.

* `MOV A, C` → Copies the content of register C into the accumulator.

## **2\. Components of an Instruction**

An 8085 instruction generally has **two parts**:

1. **Opcode (Operation Code):**

   * Specifies the operation to be performed.

   * Example: `ADD`, `MOV`, `LDA`, `JMP`.

2. **Operand(s):**

   * Data or memory/register location on which the operation is performed.

   * Can be **immediate data, register, memory, or I/O port**.

**Example:**

`MVI A, 55H`

* `MVI` → Opcode (Move Immediate)

* `A` → Destination register (operand)

* `55H` → Immediate data (operand)

## **3\. Classification of 8085 Instructions**

8085 instructions are classified based on **their functionality**. There are **5 main categories**:

---

### **3.1 Data Transfer Instructions**

* **Purpose:** Move data between registers, memory, and I/O.

* **Flags affected:** Usually **none**.

**Examples:** `MOV`, `MVI`, `LDA`, `STA`, `LHLD`, `SHLD`, `XCHG`, `IN`, `OUT`, `LXI`.

---

### **3.2 Arithmetic Instructions**

* **Purpose:** Perform arithmetic operations like **addition, subtraction, increment, decrement**.

* **Flags affected:** **Z, S, P, CY, AC**

**Examples:** `ADD`, `ADC`, `SUB`, `SBB`, `INR`, `DCR`, `INX`, `DCX`, `DAD`, `DAA`.

---

### **3.3 Logical Instructions**

* **Purpose:** Perform **bitwise operations** and logical operations on accumulator.

* **Flags affected:** **Z, S, P, CY (sometimes reset), AC**

**Examples:** `ANA`, `ORA`, `XRA`, `CMA`, `CMP`, `RLC`, `RRC`, `RAL`, `RAR`, `CPI`.

---

### **3.4 Branch / Program Control Instructions**

* **Purpose:** Control program execution flow – **jump, call subroutine, return, restart**.

* **Flags affected:** Program Counter changes; conditional instructions check flags.

**Examples:** `JMP`, `JC`, `JNC`, `JZ`, `JNZ`, `CALL`, `RET`, `RST`.

---

### **3.5 Stack / Machine Control Instructions**

* **Purpose:** Manage **stack operations, CPU control, and interrupts**.

* **Flags affected:** Usually none.

**Examples:** `PUSH`, `POP`, `XTHL`, `SPHL`, `NOP`, `HLT`, `DI`, `EI`.

## **4\. Instruction Size in 8085**

8085 instructions are of **three sizes**:

| Instruction Size | Content | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 byte | Opcode only | `CMA`, `NOP` |
| 2 bytes | Opcode \+ 8-bit operand | `MVI A, 55H` |
| 3 bytes | Opcode \+ 16-bit address | `LDA 2050H`, `JMP 3000H` |

---

## **5\. Addressing Modes Used in Instructions**

* **Immediate Addressing:** Data is part of instruction (`MVI A, 55H`)

* **Register Addressing:** Operand is in a CPU register (`MOV A, B`)

* **Direct Addressing:** Operand is in memory, address specified in instruction (`LDA 2050H`)

* **Indirect Addressing:** Operand address stored in register pair (`MOV A, M`)

* **Implied Addressing:** No operand required; CPU knows what to do (`CMA`, `HLT`)

---

## **6\. How Instructions Work**

1. **Fetch:** CPU fetches the instruction from memory.

2. **Decode:** CPU decodes opcode to understand the operation.

3. **Execute:** CPU performs the operation on the data (register/memory/I/O).

4. **Store:** Result is stored in accumulator, register, or memory if needed.

**Example:**

`ADD B`

* Fetch instruction from memory.

* Decode as ADD.

* Add content of register B to accumulator.

* Update flags (Z, S, P, CY, AC).

* Store result in accumulator.

## **7\. Summary Table of Instruction Categories**

| Category | Purpose | Flags Affected | Examples |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Data Transfer | Move data between registers, memory, I/O | None | MOV, MVI, LDA, STA, LXI, IN, OUT |
| Arithmetic | Perform math operations | Z, S, P, CY, AC | ADD, SUB, INR, DCR, INX, DAD |
| Logical | Perform logical/bitwise operations | Z, S, P, CY | ANA, ORA, XRA, CMA, CMP |
| Branch / Program Control | Jump, call, return, restart | PC changes, flag-checked | JMP, JC, JZ, CALL, RET, RST |
| Stack / Machine Control | Stack and CPU operations | None usually | PUSH, POP, HLT, NOP, EI, DI |

### **8\. Key Points**

* Instructions are **human-readable** in assembly language but stored as **machine code** in memory.

* Proper use of instructions ensures **efficient programming**.

* Understanding instruction types and addressing modes is critical for **8085 programming**.
