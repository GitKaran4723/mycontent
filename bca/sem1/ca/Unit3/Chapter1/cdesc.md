# **Computer Description** 

---

## **1\. Introduction**

A **computer** is an **electronic device** that can **accept input, process it, store it, and produce output**.

A complete computer consists of **hardware components**, **memory**, **control units**, and **input-output devices**, all working together under a set of instructions called a **program**.

---

## **2\. Basic Functions of a Computer**

A computer performs the following four main functions:

1. **Input** – Accept data and instructions from external devices (keyboard, mouse, sensors).

2. **Storage** – Store data and instructions temporarily (RAM) or permanently (ROM, disk).

3. **Processing** – Perform arithmetic and logical operations using the CPU.

4. **Output** – Produce results in human-readable form or send to other devices.

---

## **3\. Basic Components of a Computer**

A complete computer consists of **five major components**:

| Component | Function |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Input Unit** | Receives data and instructions from the user or devices |
| **Memory Unit** | Stores instructions and data temporarily (RAM) or permanently (ROM) |
| **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** | Performs arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) |
| **Control Unit (CU)** | Directs the operation of the computer, generates timing and control signals |
| **Output Unit** | Sends processed information to external devices like printer, monitor, etc. |

---

## **4\. Internal Organization**

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of the computer and consists of:

1. **Registers** – Temporary storage locations within CPU

   * **AC (Accumulator)** – Stores intermediate results

   * **DR (Data Register)** – Holds data read from memory

   * **AR (Address Register / MAR)** – Holds memory address

   * **IR (Instruction Register)** – Holds current instruction

   * **PC (Program Counter)** – Holds address of next instruction

   * **E / Link** – Carry or overflow bit

2. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

3. **Control Unit (CU)** – Directs flow of data and instructions by generating control signals.

---

## **5\. Computer Operation: How It Works**

A computer operates in a **sequence of steps called the Instruction Cycle**:

1. **Fetch** – Retrieve instruction from memory

2. **Decode** – Interpret instruction in the control unit

3. **Execute** – Perform operation in ALU or transfer data

4. **Store/Output** – Save results in memory or output device

Input → Processing → Memory → Output

---

## **6\. Types of Instructions**

1. **Memory-Reference Instructions** – Operate on data in memory (e.g., ADD, AND, LDA).

2. **Register-Reference Instructions** – Operate on CPU registers (e.g., CLA, CMA).

3. **Input-Output Instructions** – Transfer data between CPU and I/O devices (e.g., INP, OUT, ION).

---

## **7\. Memory Organization**

Memory is divided into **words**:

* Each **word stores data or instruction**.

* Memory address is used to access a word.

* Example in Basic Computer: **4K × 16 bits memory**.

**Registers interact with memory as follows:**

* **AR** – Holds address of memory location

* **DR** – Holds data read from or written to memory

---

## **8\. Data Path and Control Signals**

**Data Path:** Flow of data between CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

**Control Signals:** Commands generated by Control Unit to perform operations:

* **Read Memory (Read)**

* **Write Memory (Write)**

* **Load Register (LD)**

* **Clear Register (CLR)**

* **Increment PC (INC)**

* **Select ALU Operation**

Timing signals synchronize micro-operations with clock pulses.

---

## **9\. Input/Output Organization**

* Input devices: Keyboard, mouse, sensors → Send data to AC/DR

* Output devices: Monitor, printer → Receive data from AC/DR

* I/O flags: **FGI, FGO** indicate device ready status

* Interrupts allow CPU to handle I/O **asynchronously**.

---

## **10\. Interrupt Mechanism**

* CPU can **temporarily stop execution** to handle urgent events.

* **Steps:**

  1. Save PC and state

  2. Jump to **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**

  3. Execute ISR

  4. Resume normal program

* Controlled by **IEN (Interrupt Enable Flag)**

---

## **11\. Bus Structure**

* CPU, memory, and I/O devices communicate through a **common data bus**.

* Data moves along the bus under **control signals** from the CU.

**Registers connected to Bus:**

* AC, DR, AR, IR, PC, OUTR, INPR

---

## **12\. Timing and Control**

* Control Unit generates **timing signals (T0, T1, …)** and **control signals** to synchronize CPU operations.

* Each instruction executes in **micro-operations** triggered by timing signals.

**Example: Fetch Operation**

`T0 → AR ← PC`  
`T1 → IR ← M[AR], PC ← PC + 1`  
`T2 → Decode IR`

---

## **13\. Summary of Complete Computer Operation**

1. Input data → CPU

2. CPU stores instructions → Memory

3. CPU fetches instructions → Decode → Execute

4. CPU performs arithmetic/logical operations (ALU)

5. Results stored in memory or sent to output

6. Timing and control ensure proper sequencing

7. Interrupts allow CPU to respond to external events

---

## **14\. Advantages of This Structure**

* Organized execution of instructions

* Efficient use of registers and memory

* Supports I/O and interrupts

* Modular and expandable design
