**Data Types In JavaScript:-**

In any programming language, data types are foundational because they define what kind of data a variable can hold and how it can be used. A data type classifies the kind of value a variable holds—whether it’s text, a number, a collection, or something else. The type of data influences what operations can be performed on it, how it interacts with other data, and how it’s stored in memory.

JavaScript, as a dynamically typed language, doesn’t require you to declare data types explicitly when defining variables. Instead, JavaScript determines a variable’s type based on the value assigned to it at runtime.  
This flexibility allows for dynamic code, where variables can hold different types of values at different times, but it also demands an understanding of how JavaScript manages data types internally.

**For example:**  
let example \= 42;       // initially a Number  
example \= "Hello";      // now a String  
example \= true;         // now a Boolean

In JavaScript, we commonly declare variables using let, const, or var, but we never specify a type like "int" or "string". JavaScript automatically assigns a data type based on the value stored in the variable.

 This behavior allows for flexibility but requires a strong understanding of data types to manage unexpected type changes and ensure code accuracy.

**JavaScript Data Types:-**  
JavaScript primarily has two types of data: Primitive Data Types and Complex (or Reference) Data Types. Let’s look at each in detail.

**1\. Primitive Data Types:**  
Primitive data types represent single values and are immutable, meaning their actual value is stored directly in memory and cannot be altered. If you change a primitive’s value, it creates a new instance in memory.

Primitive Data Types in JavaScript,

**1\.	Number**  
•	Represents both integer and floating-point numbers, using a 64-bit floating-point representation.  
•	Special numeric values:  
•	Infinity: Result of dividing by zero or a calculation beyond JavaScript's maximum number limit.  
•	\-Infinity: Represents a very large negative number.  
•	NaN (Not-a-Number): Occurs when a mathematical operation fails (e.g., dividing a string by a number).  
•	Example:  
•	let count \= 5;  
•	let price \= 19.99;  
•	console.log(count); // Output: 5  
console.log(price); // Output: 19.99

**2\.	String**  
•	Represents sequences of characters used for text, enclosed in single ' ', double " ", or backtick \` \` quotes.  
•	Template literals (backticks) allow embedding variables within strings using ${} syntax.  
•	Example:  
•	let name \= "Alice";  
•	let greeting \= \`Hello, ${name}\!\`;  
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice\!

**3\.	Boolean**  
•	Represents logical values, either true or false.  
•	Used extensively in conditional statements and control flow.  
•	Example:  
•	let isOpen \= true;  
console.log(isOpen); // Output: true

**4\.	Undefined**  
•	A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value will have an undefined type.  
•	Example:  
•	let user;  
console.log(user); // Output: undefined

**5\.	Null**  
•	Represents an intentional absence of value.  
•	Often used to indicate that a variable currently holds no meaningful data.  
•	Example:  
•	let selectedColor \= null;  
console.log(selectedColor); // Output: null

**2\. Complex (Reference) Data Types:**  
Complex data types store references to values in memory rather than the values themselves. This means multiple variables can reference the same object, allowing for data to be shared and updated across references.

Complex Data Types in JavaScript,

**1\.	Object**  
•	Represents a collection of key-value pairs.  
•	Keys are typically strings, and values can be of any data type.  
•	Example:  
•	let person \= {  
•	    name: "Alice",  
•	    age: 30  
•	};  
console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice

**2\.	Array**  
•	A specialized object for storing ordered collections of data.  
•	Each element has an indexed position starting from 0, and arrays can store any data type.  
•	Example:  
•	let fruits \= \["apple", "banana", "cherry"\];  
console.log(fruits\[0\]); // Output: apple

**3\.	Function**  
•	Functions are also a type of object in JavaScript, containing executable code that can be called or invoked.  
•	Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.  
•	Example:  
•	function greet() {  
•	    return "Hello, World\!";  
•	}  
console.log(greet()); // Output: Hello, World\!
